The only other choices are, adoption or keep it.And I know many children get adopted but many don'tand it might be better off to just have an abortion tolet them suffer.That's the chance they take, I guess. But who are we todecide one womans pregnancy.
Who are we to judge what is right or wrong? Can we not just let people make decisions and live with the consequences?
I am an American, and I am ashamed to admit "Merica is rich due to slavery. India never had slavery and used to be rich until the British came and took everything away. We were left in a bad state, but started developing quickly. India is much more competitive in education than America and soon when everyone has education (which will happen in our lifetime) India will excel.India has the potential.
All my life I've grown up around religious people, always telling me abortion was wrong, murder, and immoral. But I slowly realized, it's not really a fully formed human, how could it be murder? This never made any sense, it's someone's body, if they want to abort a pregnancy, let them. Don't shame them into having a baby based on religious views. Anyway, I'm rambling, but I'm interested to see other views on this, so go ahead and try to change my view. If it matters, I'm Christian, 16, and male.
I have a strong opinion that before having children, the prospective parents should have to pass a series of background and IQ tests.Kids being brought into this world need a good foundation to start a successful life with. You may have that limited case where the parents are morons and the kids strive to be different then their failure parents, but in most cases it is an endless line of parasites on our world.We need more smart people.
with the cream layer quota system i don't prefer india to be leading the world in near future.....yes india have the potential.. but corruption , this quota system ( not helpful to anyone) , and the main reason brain drain , don't specialy help india in the matter....
Sorry, one more thing:I think it's interesting that SINGTHESTORY and SIBTIGER haven't responded to my explanation of WHY I find adoption a less than desirable alternative to abortion....Funny how people just IGNORE what they can't or don't want to argue against.If you're going to write a rebuttal to someone's argument on here, then click "view all" first. This gives you a history of their arguments and it may help to eliminate the need for that person to REPEAT themselves by addressing something they've already addressed.
A women and she alone is the one who should determine if she wants an abortion or not, at any stage of her pregnancy. Why is that it is mostly older white men who are attempting to establish anti-abortion laws for women? Why is it that most anit-abortionists are pro-death penalty?Jon Jax 71
You lost me--- 99% of what you say speaks IN FAVOR of evolution and AGAINST creationism--- At most you point out that science doesn't have all the answers (no scientist would try to counter you on that one) and that there may easily be halfway point between faith/science where evolution and creationism can co-exist (a great many liberal theologians and even agnostics would have no real problem with that idea)
What i dont undertsand is how people rationalize taking life it just doesnt make any sense... idc the situation in america how is killing leagal?
You know I really don't see why not? After all people in Europe are allowed to drink at the age of 16-Germany---and in Mexico the drinking age was 18 until now that it's 21. I think the reason why it's 21 is because people in the US are too freaking retarded and dont' know how to act right. Why in foreign countries the drinking age is lower and they actually have less accidents or anyother problems? Think about that!
Towed three times and impounded for 30 days each time?  Man, you're just not getting the message, are you?If you are in California, you bet the police can forfeit your vehicle and it doesn't take three times to make it a charm.  Technically, your vehicle could be subject to forfeiture proceedings after your first suspended license beef.  Someone like you is exactly the reason the legislature designed that law, because your privilege to drive has been taken away from you and yet you obviously continue to drive.  People like you are involved in an exponentially higher than average number of traffic accidents so the legislature figured maybe people like you should have your vehicles forfeited to the state if you just didn't go along with the game plan.Voila - I give you California Vehicle Code section 14607.6...and a link to it below.  It would also be worth your time to review 14607.4, whether or not you live in California.You really need to stop driving.  Really.
It's a lottery - luck of the draw.It will decide a winner, to be sure.But the better team doesn't always win. And truthfully shoot outs are exciting as anything any other sport can produce but it's a lazy and unfair way to decide a game, especially at the level of the World Cup.The standard argument is that if 90 minutes in regulation time and 30 more in over time doesn't produce a winner another 30 (or more) won't either.Why not?How about removing players from each side as more and more overtime is played or allow more substitutes during OT?There are many other options that can be used besides shoot outs but everyone seems to be ok with this style of game play.It is an unfair, and truthfully a sissy way to decide something so important.CMV
our waiter was fine.  very polite and attentive.  that was the best part of the meal!!!  that's sad!so disappointed in the food here!  absolutely horrible lasagna.  might be the worst i've ever had (maybe chef boyardee is worse - MAYBE!!!)do not go here to eat.  so many better places in LV!  absolutely bland and boring food.  calamari was just meh.  the meatballs were ok but kind of bland.DO NOT EAT HERE! cannot stress that enough.  unless you want to overpay for bad food. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!
As humans, we cannot know exactly if there is a higher force or not. Christianity however is not it. Firstly because it is not one belief that every Christian shares, it lacks solidarity. I compare it to a road with all different kinds of sideways. Ask a question about religion, and lots of people will find one of those sideways to adjust their religion to their personal beliefs.With Atheïsm, the concept is pretty clear. It is more scientific, and I like that.
Ethically, it's not okay for anyone to invade the privacy of an innocent person.  It's stupid and potentially dangerous to stalk celebrities, and many suits have been brought against various photographers and publications.  However, we have the right to know what the government is doing-- because it's with our money.  Governments steal from us, then use the fruits of their theft against us.Anyone arguing that the 4th Amendment protects our privacy from the government is living under a rock.  The 4th has been effectively nullified by SSNs, gun records, increasing search & seizure to look for a "probable cause", phone tapping, and the fact that the government is so vast and powerful that businesses are being forced to collude with bureaucrats and hand over what little privacy we had left.
They don't do that. It's a hollywood thing. I've been to court many times (to observe, not as a witness or anything) and I've never seen them do that. They only ask you to raise your right hand and say "I swear the statement I am about to give is the truth." Or something similar. That's all.
I feel like Physical education should be mandatory because people need there exercise. If they don't get physical activity they wont burn as much fats as they accumulate thus will get chubbier. They should be stricter during those classes of Physical education because a lot of the time people mostly just stand around. I don't want to seem sexist, but the ones that get the least exercise are the girls and they just mostly stand there and socialize. They need a way to keep everyone active, people need to get moving! They need this for there health!
Simply WrittenSeeking to advance the Common goodallows doors to be opened and barriers to bebroken, and after a journey (or) series ofconsiderate acts one can have an less-difficulttime Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.The word for this debate is[sacrifice]How much would a person really "sacrifice"for his or her neighbor without beingblinded by the light beemed from selfishness??No matter where a person is in thier life....Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!
If you are with your children, supervising them, then you wouldn't need a registry to do it for you. It is your responsibility as a parent to supervise your children at all times. If you will look at the horrendous crimes against children, they are children that were not being supervised by a parent. Also, 90 to 95% of sex offenses occur by someone known to the child within the family or close friends. Stranger danger is not all that prevalent and the registries do nothing but provide a false sense of security.
People always talk about how unfair it is to discriminate against people, but I see tons of discrimination and hatred against the rich (especially on reddit). I think this discrimination is just as morally wrong as all other forms of discrimination.  America is always talked about as a free society and a land of equality, but how free and equal can it be if it charges certain people more for being more productive?!?!  Additional taxes and discrimination on the productive also serve the effect of discouraging this behavior (or encouraging it to happen elsewhere where Americans don't benefit from spillover effects), and our subsidy system for poor people (especially regarding reproduction) has grown the ranks of the poor by millions.
Being horny is a sin.Wanking is a sinHaving sex with your girlfriend is a sinRaping is a sinIf this is what young men are taught, how can they have an concept of what wrong and right actually are. We should teach morals not religion.Religion teaches natural feelings are wrong. You don't tell a woman feeling cold is wrong so why tell a man acting on hornyness is wrong? I'm not say rape is right just that consential sex with a girlfirend is not wrong and putting the two in the same context of a 'sin' is causing rape.
my friend is, in my opinion, being stupid. she is gonna move to texas to a place where she will be in the minority. 13% of the entire town is white. mostly gang territory. not far from the mexican border. leaveing everything behind, includeing family and friends. most people tell her to stay. What do you think?
I would support the fact of being fatherless then having a lousy father. Fathers most likely are supposed to be the provider for the household and solve the problems that comes in hand because his like the alpha male but if your lousy then what point is it for you to have around. Kids look towards their father as an example of how to be a man and to have responsibility's over the actions they make. so why not be fatherless when having a lousy father is the same thing.
Raffles had a vision for Singapore that it will be an orderly, elegant, rational and modern and he worked towards it. And while Raffles was gone, Farquhar developed Singapore poorly causing Raffles to feel dissappointed.
I think it's better to have a lousy father then fatherless, because a father just being in the childs life has a huge impact on the child. Without a father, the child will not feel secure in a certain sense. Of course, mothers give that feeling, but fathers give it in another way. A girl for example, girls who have fathers are less careless then girls without. To me, I see girl's who don't have fathers grow up a hard life. Boys, they probably feel like they have to take on the fatherly responsiblity as they get older. Which shouldn't be the case.
We already have this, it is called the Social Security Card.Every employer can call the SSA and verify the information of a given social security number.  Our government has just made it so difficult to do this that most employers will not take the time.When you are hired for a job, you are supposed to provide I-9 documentation.  You can use a passport, or state issued id & social security card (not just number), or birth certificate & ss card, etc.  There are already laws and fines in place regarding improperly documenting your workers.  The problem is our elected officials would rather waste our money & time by presenting completely new regulations (justifying their jobs) instead of making the appropriate government administration enforce the laws we already have.Politicians are becoming better and better at doing nothing but creating redundent worthless laws.  And we keep re-electing them.So I would NOT vote for this ridiculous limit on my freedom and waste of the American taxpayers' monies.
I haven't followed this political case, but I believe that any law named after a person is questionable since those pusing it will often be reacting based on emotion and grief, rather than reason.Any good law will have safeguards, and rational provisions so that whatever action is made illegal is really the action that is the threat. I generally oppose laws that make actions illegal just because they might, in combination with other actions, have the potential to cause harm. I believe in punishing those who cause the harm, and not limiting action based purely on speculation.That being said, the voting process has become an emotional one. People -- whether voters or legislators -- pass laws based on their gut reactions, often without any concern for the consequences or long term effects. Logic and reason have largely been abandoned in favor of making headlines.And sadly, that's not likely to change any time soon. Good luck.
If 1/2 the schools in the US thinks yes, then teachers are not doing well in the history aspect of education. Now, these kids need to know their rights, and the rights of others. I thought schools get taught the Constitution and bill of rights. At least I would expect thee civil war to be mentioned before 6th grade, the rest would follow. Freedom of speech, FREEDOM OF PRESS, freedom of religion, and so on. With this knowledge one can understand why America is America and not new great Brittan or some British ruled country paying taxes on land we are not living and harvesting from. ( ha, nowadays, this country is doing all kinds of illegal activities. No wonder why 1/2 the youth is lost and confused)
Basically I am asserting since the storm-cloaks are painted as the complete villain out of the two choices their( the storm-cloaks and the empires war) is a weaker section of the skyrim story. Let's break down why the storm-cloaks are bad. They are racist they abuse and mistreat those different from them this makes them evil by today's morales and paints them( the storm-cloaks) as the villains and Ulfric as the mastermind. Secondly Ulfric used thu'um to kill the high king, basically he invoked an ancient and powerful gift to kill another bad guy deed. This is what makes the storm-cloaks the obvious bad guys they have nothing that paints them as good in any way except for not being the one to want to cut your head of at the beginning. Try to CMV by proving to me the storm-cloaks aren't just Saturday morning cartoon villains.
syona if look at glance, then most of us are unable to specify any solid solutions by which we can remove the hurdle in our progress from root.we all are very much aware of problems but unable to give solutions.they are criticizing government,terrorism and so on.no one realizes that being a citizen what is our duty?everyone should understand abt. their importance and role for country.Because a good citizen,a criminal,terrorist,corrupted politician, everyone is human, then why a human is creating problem for another human.I hope you will think my views and reply me soon.
Raffles unjustly removed Farquhar from his position in Singapore and accused him of ' being too close to the local population '. I think that it is unfair that a person who contributed so much to Singapore's development be unjustly sent off like that.
i LIKE porn, jerking off is always a good time
tv is better than books because you learn easier by seeing not read
I feel that people should have the right to explore their own consciousness as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else in the process. Obviously similar laws to alcohol should exist, where you can't be tripping in public &amp; such. As more and more research continues, scientists are finding that psychedelics such as Psilocybin (Shrooms) and LSD are pretty harmful as far as drugs go, Especially compared to legal substances such as Alcohol and Tobacco. Psychedelics also aren't addictive either. I feel that if all these drugs do is often improve the users quality of life, and they aren't addictive or proven to be mentally or physically harmful, then I don't see why they should be illegal.Obviously when I say "psychedelics" I'm referring to the ones that are as I described: harmless and non-addictive. Psychedelics such as nBOMe's and other ones that may be harmful should not be legalized.
I don't think its a waste of time but i think it is pointless because our world ( Earth ) Has its own bigger problem like world poverty, population, polution, and the biggest threat...Global Warming. Which will kill 6.5 billion maybe even more people as we speak. Scientists could be foucusing on our world problems frist and try to fix those instead of trying to make other planets better to live on. What if we focus on that and near the eand we find out it is impossible to do and everyone will die because of scientist caring to much about other things when there lives also could be in stake
I think doodling should be mandatory in foreign language classes and science classes, i retained more in both because we were given assignments involving drawing and comics. Doodling has helped me focus more on whatever my teachers are saying, simple squiggly lines do the best. Though i must admit that when i start to "doodle" my doodles tend to turn into full blown drawings, shading and color thrown in the mix. Thats when i get off task... i should probably figure out how to keep from caring too much about visual appeal and just sketch and doodle stuff...
Bad. I'm too lazy to explain why so take my word for it. I had to wear one for 4 years at school.
It shouldn't be used constantly but it should be used to get the message across to the child
Not to be glib, but are you stating that we should look to the government to assist us with our belief system.Ever read T. Hobbes...?
i do not see any difference in killing an embroyo or a 40 year old person. Murder....is murder
Gym class is a useless class that students waste time in. There should be a test and if people can not run a mile without stopping every couple feet they should join. There is also the fact people can join to get prepared for sports. Students should have that class time to use it towards their careers and not a class that is just there.
Do gay marriages hurt anyone? No. Do gay marriages kill many people? No. Are gay marriages going to end the world? No. Are gay marriages in anyway affecting anyone but the two getting married? No. Then why the hell do straight ppl get so offensive? If you want marrage to just be between you fine let them do something else to show they love each other. Bottom line, if you love someone you should be allowed to be with them. God accepts everyone, his people should follow that. Bottom line, it should be a sin to kep two people who love each other apart. Enough said.
Because we are not taught from a young age to respect alchohol. If we treated it more like Europeans it would not be considered taboo. Thats why so many teenagers have to drink till they get sick and act like twits. Also those stupid ass ads that connect drinking beer with being sexy. You aint sexy when you get drunk. Backwards is alcohol thinking in America.
_____I know that with science most people are now able to have children but i fell its just selfish. There are thousands of orphans around the world who are up for adoption and to spend what is over $3000 just to get a surrogate doesn't sit right with me. Also the most successful suorrgate agencies happen in foreign countries where they take advantage of the woman because they can pay them so little in order to use their bodies. Child birth can take a lot out of a woman physically speaking so knowing that a woman went throght that just to give birth to a child she will never see again doesn't seem right.
I pity those of you on the other side. The annoying load of pop ups and viruses IE has, yet you continue to use it?!Main reason I love Firefox has to be the tab option. The last time I checked IE requires you to get up a whole new browser in order search two websites at the same time. It's pointlessss. :/OH AND.Firefox saves the website(s) you were last at in case of a restart or something. Yeah, I don't know, it just has so many cool features I don't have time to list them all.
books make you more intelligent. they can also say what people are thinking.
some ppl cant read is absolutely idiotic to saythe ppl who cant read wud always run away frm dembt even den B for books nd B for bestso books r da besti cant sleep if i wont read a chapter frm any novel each daybt actually sometimes i feel reading books all day becomes boring (in schools textbooks nd at home novels) so only sometimes i watch tv nd dat 2 news channelshence by reading books i can even pass my time nd even improve my speaking skills
Its an indisputable fact that the average IE user gets laid 2500% more than the average firefox user.sorry firefox losers...gamesetmatchgo cry about IE somewhere else 8*^(
I don't ever wanna be hereLike punching in a dream breathing life into my nightmareIf it falls apart I would surely wake itBright lights turn me cleanThis is worse than it seems
I say, sentence them to life in prison and put them in our worst supermax prison and keep them in the general population with a t-shirt that reads: "I'm a terrorist and kill innocent women and children." Surely the guards will turn a blind eye to whatever unfortunate things happen to a convicted terroist.  I think we would find that there is still honor among thieves.Might not deter anyone, but what will?
You can watch TV in one sitting where as a book takes all day to read. So no physical exercise will get done reading books. Exercise shows on TV make you move. SO TV IS WAY BETTER THEN BOOKS!!!!!!!
having some choices are good. but if you were in charge of all the choices in your life, the world would be in total chaos. i have always been pro life. and yes i do believe abortions should be illegal.
Yes, prostitution should absolutely be legalized; let local governments decide if they want it or not and handle it either through ordinances or zoning laws.  Same thing with drugs - decriminalization or outright legalization would allow governments to raise revenues that could be spent on treatments and public health action, and would take away a source of more violent criminal activity that supports these illegal trades.  There's no reason these things should be illegal, and every reason they should be legalized.
Even if there arent any minors, the language which you use , should atrract the people and not distract.There is a psychology which works in the minds of such people who keep ' I dont care ' kind of the attitude.They think that you cant catch them. They dont even care to see your reaction. They dont wait for  one.They know well that thier answer will never be chosen as the best, so why care ? Just vomit and earn few points.Moreover it takes some brains to answer a question which they dont have.Most of them feel pleasure and become sadistic in thier approach.Come on....'freedom of speech' is also an abusive term.The ethics, values etc are contrary to the concept of freedom of speech. You have got plenty of choices to choose words and its a pity if one cant find them and starts using fowl language.Therefore I advise you not to be afraid of such animals and keep on sharing your knowledge with us.Hope to hear from you soon.
Be careful. If you keep making sense, they'll start listening to your phone calls and reading your e-mail. Oops...too late.Frankly, if they really wanted to "defend marriage", they should repeal all divorce laws and make adultery a felony. That would "defend marriage" - except half of Congress would be sitting in jail. [probably not a bad idea]
Granted I've never had trouble with this issue with a significant other, but once in an office building and once staying with a female friend (the later of which I understand because it's her house and she wants it maintained a certain way).The argument is that it's considerate but the counterpart of putting the seat up after use is never put on the table. And even if it were then it just cancels the whole thing out. And in a large building or household there the next person to use the toilet could be male and need to urinate in which case he now needs to put the seat up again. Lastly, why the fuck would you use a shared toilet without looking before using it while expecting male users to do the looking for both themselves and the women.
THIS PLACE NOT ONLY HAS NASTY ASS BURGERS BUT THE SERVICE IS HORRIBLE!  After i orderded people were waiting for over 40 minutes and there plane was boarding so they started yelling into the kitchen "JUST GIVE ME WHAT U GOT!" PUAHAHHAA  thats when i relized i should of went elsewhere...I ordered the ruby burger i realized i may have missed ordered cause i realized there was no cheese with this burger, but come on plz put some mayo on my burger and dont over cook  my paddy!  I felt like i was eating a card board burger! SOOO nasty i only ate most of it cause i paid for it and i was hungry.  Fries were fries nothing special....Wanted to go to burger king originally but the gate was closed to go there!NEVER GOIN HERE AGAIN!
Advancing the Common good is a better endeavor than a personal pursuit. For example there are those who want to help others. A personal pursuit however is only for those selfish people who only care about themselves. The common good happens to some from a loan for college, to a charity for an orphanage, a school, etc
I just attended a lecture yesterday that talked about these very statistics.  Our crime rate is actually going down, but our rate of incarceration is going up.  This reflects the US' "war on crime" and "war on drugs" started in the late 70s, early 80s (Reagan, mostly).  It's because we are taking action and using incarceration as the solution.  To really properly analize these numbers, you also have to look at the crime rates of all these nations (we also score very poorly, there, so you still have a point).  The statistics for african-americans is even worse - something like 6000+ african-american inmates per 100,000.
Sounds to me like you want to teach this person a lesson. Sorry to say that those are not good legal grounds for a lawsuit.  You will never find an attorney to take this kind of case on contingency.  So, if you really want to pursue this you'll have to do it out of pocket, which will be obscenely expensive.If your reputation was not in fact harmed then I would say to have a talk with the person, their boss, etc and then let it go.
This type of question only reinforces the view of anti-gunners about how they view legal gun-owners.Your question should be, "Why is it that every country that's enforced gun bans has an increase in person-to-person crimes and burglaries?"Or, "Since some countries that have banned guns and have seen an increase in crime, why don't their governments reinstate their gun rights so the citizens can protect themselves?"See how that's more diplomatic, and more inviting to a intelligent discussion about the issue, instead of introducing hositlity and open biases into it?
As simplistic as this sounds, from a socio-economic standpoint, mainstream activist feminism (tumblr feminism aside) is beginning to look like a group of middle class/upper middle class women bullying the poor and working class over their day-to-day behavior, while leaving the institutions that hurt women of all classes untouched.  Some women writing in a feminist bent (particularly the movements involving teaching women to be more assertive in the workI think supporting the basic concept of feminism (all human beings should be treated equally regardless of gender) is a no-brainer, but I don't understand the emphasis on low-hanging fruit like street harassment. The comments of construction workers don't determine the wage of women, or their ability to participate in American economic or political life. The actions and comments of people like Justin Mateen do. So why aren't there hordes of young activists protesting outside of Tinder's offices? Why do street harassment and terms of address merit more attention than institutional discrimination?
I believe it can be justified to be afraid of one of the only major religions that calls for violence against non-believers in it's scriptures.For instance:"But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, and seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war)....." Surah 9:5or: “O ye who believe! Fight the Unbelievers who gird you about, and let them find firmness in you: and know that Allah is with those who fear Him” (Surah 9:123)And while I understand that many verses of peace are in the Koran, they are abrogated by the later verses of war.Also, while many wars are fought for religion by all religions, Islam is the only one that calls for violence in it's Koran, unlike Christianity or Judaism.Based on this, I find a fear of Islam rational and justified.
Three debates in one day criticizing my veiws on upholding convinceme's seriousness.Convinceme is the ONLY administrator for this website.What he says goes.If he wants to post rules condemning or dignifying anything, I will follow them.But he hasn't. He has left us as a community to make our own decisions.I have every right to flag any debate which I see as inappropriate or harmful to the community.If convinceme strongly opposed what I am doing, he would have banned me, or at least sent me a PM about it.I dislike the fact that intelligent debates get easily ran over by repeats. It is taking away the seriousness of this website which I have come to appreciate, and feel obligated to preserve.I'm sure many of you agree with me, but only stop me because you feel I hold selfish ambitions.
Books are better than TV because books have each and every detail briefly . we get to read books like story books , fairy tales, ghost stories etc these books help us in bringing imaginary power in us . In TV only some points are explained and sometimes we cant remember it easily but in books if we forget anything we can now and then read it .At last I only want to tell that books are much and much better than TV .
Reality Tv is garbage... First of all it is scripted... just meant for amusment and it is not really reality. People live vicarously through reality tv shows. Reality TV shows influence our children in a negative manner, for example the bachelor, teachers our young teenage girls that we have to be beautiful and fight for a man with 20 different women to get their attention to have a fairy land wedding, that is not reality. Also, many of the reality shows, such as rock of love, flavor flav, demean women in a sense and this is what our children grow up watching.
bad company is boring its hard to kill people on there and the controls are weird the vehicles are boring and are hard to control for some reason also the maps are waaaaaaay to big.on cod the map called wastland is one of the biggest and people hate that map.mw2 is very intense because it keeps you wondering whats about to come from around that corner or if a sniper is up in a window or hiding on a roof ready to put a bullet in your head or if your about to get hit by a thrown grenade but through all that that goes through your mind as your playing you get hit from behind and your down.battlefield is boring because you always no where the enemy is and you dont have to go get them you can just drive around being bored and the maps are to big to go out of your way to kill someone unlike on mw2 your thrown into the meat grinder of survival with only three magazines of ammo and skills that take time to developed.plus weapons on mw2 are realistic except for the at4 which is not a guided munition.
the number of reasons on why ff ie are LISTLESS(:
Unless the brain is used no human being can understand any medium. Be it TV or books. By watching the television people can create a make believe situation and think. "What if they would go left? They would be SAVED, wouldn't they?" Even viewing tv requires brains. And moreover we can watch television in the dark. But to read a book you need the lights on. Which also wastes electricity.
Yes I would say it has you relax in case your tired, but you can read to relax as well. Plus have you ever considered about the commercials and how annoying they are?
Yes it is illegal in the USA.  However, it can be done.  The person I know who's done it has never had a problem with the medications (in this case from India), and never had a problem with Customs or the Postal Inspector, etc.  I would not recommend it for drugs needed to treat serious life threatening conditions, because the quality is supposedly questionable.  But for other drugs I would do it if I didn't live so close to Mexico (where I can just go over the border and buy cheap prescription meds).If you do a google search on the drug name that you need, you will most likely find an overseas site which offers it for sale.Good luck, but remember it's illegal and potentially dangerous to your health.
Although technically, the previous answers are right ( you should pay your rent because of your contract etc), I would advise that you hold on to that rent payment and don't pay him! He sounds like a bit of a rogue, and if he is a crook you won't be seeing the whole amount of your deposit returned (typically landlords like him make up reasons such as cleaning bills, delapidation etc in order to retain your money) You're moving out at the end of December anyway and he has no power to just 'throw you out', he'd have to get an eviction notice and go through certain legal proceedures. The chances of him taking you to court are very slim, he would only do this if he thought you had caused damage to the property, but it sounds as though the property wasn't completely legal anyway (basic rights are to have a corgi certificate, working appliances etc)So, I say sod him!! Good luck x
Of course they would if they got in a position where they didn't want a child.  When a lot of those pro-lifers do get in that situation they will try to say something like "Oh I'm not like to the other females, because this or that happen, so this is why I'm having an abortion".  It's usually okay for them, but their anti-abortion when it's someone else.
Marijuana smoking should be legalised everywhere.It is a simple natural herb, which provides pleasure and relaxation, and has many beneficial medicinal properties. It relieves stress, reduces pain, and certain studies show that it can disipate asthma, and be beneficial to alzheimer's patients.The reason it was made illegal in the first place was because the oil from the seeds can be used to fuel an engine, and so the oil lobby, along with the media who were making profits from cutting down trees, found a way to make it illegal. The law was passed as a part of the tax law, which introduced the name marijuana, so that nobody would realise that they were restricting the use of hemp.
Why did the "true" gods of today's religions not see fit to make themselves known to early people from the Mesopotamian region? Wouldn't the Christian God, being a jealous god, have made himself known earlier than he did? If he's not really jealous, that still leaves the question of why he let man wonder around so long worshiping "false gods". Doesn't this provide reason to doubt all religions? How do we know that the earliest gods who were worshiped, aren't sitting "up there" seriously ticked off? Pissed that we are claiming each of their individual hard efforts to make us and the world we live in is actually the effort of one god? Pissed, that after explicitly putting their word forth, we strayed and worshiped false idols?
the cause to all problems is miscomunication because...car acccidents cause by drivers unawere of what other drivers are doingsomething turning into gossip because somebody did not take the time to say the full storyfights caused by 2 people who did not comumacate the rules about a game proplyterrirists blowing people up because the goverment would not listen to there concerns in the first placethere are lots more need i go on.
Humans are known as homo sapiens and are part of the animal kingdom. Therefore humans are animals. And how can a human be "above" an animal? What qualifies as above? Should there be some sort of intelligence limit that divides humans from being classified as animals? How does greater intelligence lift humans out of the animal category? Would an extremely bright dolphin no longer count as an animal? I must admit that humans are very different from the rest of the animal world, but I don't see how this elevates us in any way.
There is no disagree side but I disagree. There is a very good chance something may erupt between the U.S. and Iran. They and many other Arab/Muslim nations hate the West and are supporting terrorist organizations. So if a devastating attack occurs within the next few years Iran is the number one target. Also people have to realize that Israels interests are Americas interests; they are one in the same. So even if we do not have a war/conflict with Iran directly there is a good chance Israel may; which would involve us in the situation. The neoconservatives have been planting the seeds for some time now. Hopefully people can see how dangerous a group of people they are and how inaccurate they have been about their predictions. I hope it does not happen but there will be no fundamental change in our Middle Eastern foreign policy so war and conflict seem inevitable.
i think with this growing condition Idia cannot replace other developed countries like USA LONDON AND other countries.Because most of the people are illitrate here so i think india cant.
yes, i believe it's nice to have a school uniform. Each school 's uniform signifies its goal for instant i wore white shirt and blue skirt in my school days, white color is an indication of peace and blue of fidelity in relationships moreover identical uniform also removes the wall of status. it also depicts that whether a child comes from high or low class they all are treated equally under one roof .
An action is ethical if society as a whole would benefit if we all did it. Fair enough?If everyone had a gay marriage, then society as a whole would NOT benefit. In fact, we would all become extinct, because without one man and one woman there would be no reproduction and continuation of our species.Therefore, gay marriage can't be ethical.You can't refute my statement by saying, "There will always be straight people" because that's like saying killing someone is right because there will always be those who won't kill.
Many of these answers talk about the woman being able to choose what is going to happen to her body. What about the babies choice? No baby would decide...I"I think I want to be partially born, (at a time when I COULD live outside my mothers body) be stabbed in the skull and have my brain sucked out. How selfish are the women who think it is all about them and what they need or want? People that support this should be forced to watch one being performed......LIVE!
* Hamas has fired some 2000 missiles into Israel over the past 2 weeks despite numerous attempts by Israel to cease-fire without retaliation.* Hamas declining/ignoring these opportunities of peace have left Israel with no options besides retaliation. With the main goal of Hamas being to destroy Israel; Israel has the right to neutralize Hamas to ensure the safety of Israeli citizens.* Israel should not be held accountable for civilian casualties in Gaza when Hamas is actively trying to increase civilian casualties by firing missiles out of civilian buildings.* I believe the disregard for civilian casualties by Hamas and continual bombing of Israel is enough justification to invade Gaza and prevent further bombings.
I think the pusillanimous behavior of professional soccer players playing up a slight bump by a member of the opposing team is unsportsmanlike and gives a poor image to the sport overall. It seems as though the player who was one moment ago crying out in agony is nearly always up running around after the other guy receives a yellow card (presumably because the first guy just received an almost death blow). If you look at football, basketball, etc., the players always brush off the bump and go right back into the game. Of course, I'm not saying that legit injuries don't occur, or that fouls shouldn't be punished. I'm simply saying that soccer is full of fakers and it pisses me off. Change my view.
So, this place is a dumpy neighborhood bar located in a not-so great strip mall basically in an alley. For some reason, people bring their kids to this place even though it's a bar so it's usually really noisy. The food is actually really good. The wings are delicious and flavorful as are the buffalo chicken wraps and the onion rings. They are crispy, battered and greasy just like onion rings should be. Their ranch tastes homemade and is very good. Note that this is the kind of place where the bartenders/waitresses know most folks and when we were there, we happened to be sitting in someone's "regular" booth and the group of dads were playing fantasy football with their kids (???) so we felt the need to split so the gang could sit together. So, it is a neighborhood dive bar, lots of noisy kids, good food. Service is okay at best.
this is a load of bull excrament. These arguments are not factual and make your team seem like a bunch of foolish fools.
At Poland Spring, we know that freshness and consistency go hand in hand. Our rigorous quality control standards help us make sure that you will enjoy the same crisp, delicious water every time you take a sip.To maintain the purity of our water, we employ a comprehensive, multi-barrier filtration system that involves carefully controlled and continuously monitored disinfection processes in hygienically designed lines. We test our water when it comes into the plant and for consistency several times per hour at every stage of the bottling process. Every year, we screen for over 200 possible contaminants-far more than state and federal regulations require.-nuff saidhttp://delivery.polandspring.com/Delivery/home/help/OurWater.aspx
Is incestual marriage right or wrong? Does gay marriage include incestual homosexual marriage?Which country legalized homosexual unions which lead to a lower marriage rate?
I am a christian. The bible says plain out that homosexuality is wrong. Call me pathetic, weak, or whatever you want to call me, but I know for sure that the bible is the TRUTH, the WHOLE truth, and the ONLY truth.
Yes, it should be of unlimited proportions. Freedom of speech should not and cannot be twisted to the point where it is no longer freedom of speech.However, freedom of speech goes hand in hand with the idea of personal responsibility and accountability. Producing those cartoons was technically legal, but it was irresponsible. Surely the cartoonist knew that those cartoons would cause trouble in extremist countries.However, I also think that the Islamic world is greatly overreacting. They are ruining their credibility and making themselves look like a bunch of whinging little kids who riot at the most petty insult. Do you know how many "Jesus Christ" parody websites exist online? How many Christians burn down embassies for stuff like that?
i think it could be argued that we already exist in exactly that misogynistic world you describe: - in the united states women are paid only 75¢ for every $1.00 a man is paid for the identical work.- 70% of the 1.3 billion people in the world loving in poverty are women.- two-thirds of the children denied even an elementary education are girls.- 75% of the world's 900 million illiterate adults are women.- women work two-thirds of the world's working hours and produce half the world's food, yet only earn 10% of the world's income and own less than 1% of the world's property.tell me exactly, how we're on such an even keel? how can anyone NOT be a feminist?
The growth in bottled water production has increased water extraction in areas near bottling plants, leading to water shortages that affect nearby consumers and farmers. In addition to the millions of gallons of water used in the plastic-making process, two gallons of water are wasted in the purification process for every gallon that goes into the bottles.
*For the international CMVs the term greek refers to a social component of my university that throws open parties every weekend. Each party has a theme/dress code.*A lot of people may say that to a certain extent everything is alright in fun and humor, but I believe that organizing parties with dress codes that allow people to dress up as racial stereotypes should be frowned upon and ultimately banned.By allowing these parties to go on as a college community, we are furthering the segregation, discrimination, and undermining of our international cultures as they are portrayed as a "joke" to those who attend in attire.Ultimately, by forbidding the use of these themes (in favor of more non racially specific party themes such as black light or tropical) we are protecting the integrity of our international and ethnical students, while very little harm is done on the greek end.
So, if you are on a beer run with friends and one of them forgets their I.D. but they are not purchasing, requiring them to show I.D. is both a useless and inconvenient policy. I can understand why they would have it, but even following basic rational thought it doesn't make sense.There's nothing stopping the person buying the products from walking out of the store, and walking right back in alone, to a different register or going to the next store over to do the same thing or ultimately, preventing any real liability on the part of wal-mart. If someone who is 21+ buys for a minor, the law will attack them, not the selling institution. All this does is discourage people from buying alcoholic products at the store in the first place.CMV.
It is 6:53 PM and I wanted a juice. The clerk behind the counter proceeded to tell me that they have already sanitized the juice machine for the night. Pulp does not close until 9 PM. What a horrible experience and terrible customer service. Pulp does not close for over two hours. Really?I have been coming here for about a month and during that time the wheatgrass shot machine has been down. I figured OK it is a small shop how long could it take but a month later (according to a Nother customer it's been almost 2 months) and still no wheatgrass. Now this. I will not be returning.
So I have been here before but now as Yama sushi has become so popular and big the sushi has 2x more rice than before and less fish, also the service has dropped to something impermissible, on too of the fact that they recently got a B- Health Inspection rating for 16 violations most of them being the fish not being kept at proper temperatures. Go somewhere else, or just make sure you get good service.
firefox is much better.It remembers passwords with greater gusto.add-ons allow you to personalize your browser in every way. I love - tabs (aging and remembering them when you close the browser, weatherfox, gestures,there is even a tab that lets you display the page in IE format if something is incompatible (rare, only SAP at work)and the way you can put the link logos in the tool bar rocks.much friendlier and a better browser, and not just because i don't want to support MS. Because i don't care about that, a good product is a good product.
I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.
Children have two role models; mom and dad. Parents affect their child's behavior and personality so if that relationship is damaged then the child's character can be damaged as well. I would prefer to be fatherless because the damage of a lousy father would scar my personality far greater than being fatherless.
The internet is still such a recent phenomenon, that laws and policies are being created as we speak.But unless you're pretty certain they'll be OK with it, you should ask someone if you can put a link to their website on your blog. That would  be the right thing to do from an ethical standpoint as well.A lot of people create 'banners' for other people to put on their websites as a link to their's. But some people don't mind if you put the URL.Bottom line is, when in doubt check it out. I can't answer your question about the legal ramifications (see link, below). But my bet is that you could end up getting into some hot water with someone if they haven't given you permission prior to your adding the link. Why risk it? It's just a matter of asking.
Not if it happened outside the workplace and after working hours.  As far as I know, sexual harrassment only occurs when the person receiving the comment, approach, or inappropriate personal contact perceives it as insulting, demeaning, or threatening.  Many people bend the sexual harrassment rules in the workplace by hitting on or accepting remarks from their co-workers.  I think that policies against sexual harrassment exist only for the workplace environment (whichever this environment may be).  But I believe that a person can get in trouble with the cops if he or she is accused of bothering another person in a sexual way.
Misinformed voting is a problem, and I think that introducing a way to cut down on the amount of misinformed votes is important. The test that would be implemented would not be very difficult, but would ensure that the voter had read the bill before they vote. I believe something like this could be accomplished by trials in which sample populations who have not yet read the bill would be allotted a certain amount of time to read the bill, and then answer a variety of multiple choice questions. From this information, researchers could pick and choose questions that those with a poor high school education could answer having read the bill. -EDIT-I would like to also say that this would be an 'open book' test; the bill would literally be in front of them.
I was reading the post today about the supposed Malaria vaccine when it occurred to me that while it's terrific that this discovery will end the suffering of infected people and eradicate the potential to put more through that sickness, it will ultimately result in an increase in world population. Every new development in sickness prevention or life elongation contributes to the steady and inevitable increase in people on this earth. The bottom line is that people will increasingly die at a smaller rate while new people are increasingly born at a greater rate. The earth cannot sustain this. Is there another point of view that would help me enjoy these medical discoveries more? All I see is a bleak future fast approaching as more people live longer.
I believe the current situation in North Korea is no laughing matter yet when scrolling through comments on reddit, whenever there is a mention of North Korea, it is almost certain that a joke about it will follow. The jokes mask the reality of the situation and although a small percentage of the people commenting may actually believe in what they're saying, to most, the living conditions, mass executions, labor camps, and the advancement of nuclear technology in North Korea is something we should be aware of and possibly take action to better the situation.I understand people have a right to joke about whatever they want, after all, they are just jokes. But to me, I find them just as insensitive and inappropriate as joking about the holocaust, other genocides, and injustices to human rights.And yes... I do expect the top comment to be a joke about being banned from /r/pyongyang
Sometimes a girl just wants some Matzoh Ball soup and this place is one of my faves... I will say it has been inconsistent from time to time (sometimes being less flavorful than others but that is not always the case--- I have been satisfied more times than not.  Sandwich selection is good, veggie burger is one of the better ones I have tried, and they are generous with their portions.  We often use Wheel Deliver to get the Smallman Street Deli and everything is always marked properly and the orders never have issues (unlike many places who do large lunches unfortunately).  I will keep patronizing this yummy place...
I think it is usually acceptable to break the law if, by not breaking it, someone would suffer bodily harm or death. Also, if the law is fundamentally designed to discriminate, I think that at the very least some people need to break it in order to be able to argue against it in the Supreme Court, for example when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat.
Watching documentaries and reading books about the Seattle scene, it is common to hear references to how good some other bands were and how Nirvana were not that special. I think the Melvins said they were a bunch of bums who hit the jackpot. Well I have gone back and listened to a lot of bands mudhoney, Green River, Sonic youth and others and i'm sorry to say I never heard anything close to a 'Lithium' or a 'Smells like teen spirit' .Those songs are magical and have beautiful, haunting and unforgettable melodies and really good pop hooks. There were other great bands that are in the same league like Pearl jam and to a lesser extent Alice in Chains and Soundgarden..but no I dont buy the Spiel that Nirvana were 'just another band'.
The realism in games such as call of duty and battlefield mirror that of the cop and soldier training simulators designed to teach people knee jerk methods on shooting others.Observing depictions of human death and suffering has become the past time for millions of kids around the world. To think that the mind is not being trained to be more violent through media seems illogical to me. In ww2 there was a serious problem with soldiers not shooting there guns and not having the will power to, so the militarily started introducing the man shaped silhouette to pop up so the soldiers could learn based on stimulus response to shoot a human figure. Kids are being taught that they can gain points or a high score through human death and suffering.Change muh view
Even though it is true that Raffles did not work closely with the population to develop Singapore, he provided plans, ideas and was going to put them in action by himself when his superiors ordered him to Bencoolen. Hence it was common sense for Raffles to leave his subordinate to finish his ideas
I volunteer at Irving Cares, and when I do I feel so great that I can help the community. To me when I help advance the common good I am helping myself. When people do something for the good of others it helps them out in the long run. Whether it is a favor in return or anything else. In a personal pursuit you are just helping yourself. If we all just helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me.
Bush assumes it will put US at risk of loosing the edge in industrial production.The agreement will put stricter restrictions on emissions from various industries in america.To adhere to the standards america needs to upgrade a large number of industries.Another reason is these agreements will be fully implemented in usa but the other third world countries does not have the financial power or expertise to implement it. So the third world countries will be polluting and producing cheap products while US will be investing in new technologies and creating expensive products.But in the long run US will reap the benefits if it signs the environmental agreement, as we have only one earth.
Cannot believe didnot write a review for this placeLocated inside the Planet Hollywood and its open 24/7.Great place to go to when you have the munchies while yourRecommendations-Full Montagu..Beef and turkey..Its a very tasty sandwich .-Holiday Turkey..Wow it taste like a turkey plate with stuffing, turkey and cranberry. Very good if you like turkey.-Original...Just Ok..Its beef sandwich and it was nothing special.Usually stick to either Full Montagu or Holiday Turkey.All sandwiches are under $7 so what a deal!!!They also have salads and soups.Line moves pretty quickly so donot let the long line scare you away...
I think that personal pursuit is better because i think that helping yourself before others is natural. I think that no matter what you do everything comes back you even if your helping others, because you dont want your life to be out of whack helping others.
Men have been hit hardest by the recession, and have not bounced back well. Lots of men remain unemployed, and men are going to college at lower numbers than ever.Meanwhile, women are being given incentives to go into colleges and fields that men are not.There exist lots of secure jobs (teaching and nursing are the most readily available and accessible examples) that are 90% female, both in the field and in college majors. Considering the higher male unemployment, I think anyone offering a female-specific incentive such as a STEM scholarship should be required to promote a male-specific scholarship to a female-dominated field.Please CMV.
Just look at our own bodies, we have residues of our ancestors, we shiver and get bimps like reptiles, our hair stands on its end when frightned and we all have tail bones, I am not an atheist, I believe in God, I just believe that God set things up with the creation of the universe knowing what would happen including that what was created woul evolve and turn into life and that life would continue to evolve, it's all part of the Master's plan-I have no conflict between believing in God and evolution and neither do a growing number of progressive believers of God of various denominations
I would make the argument that people are basically good. That is not to say that all people are good all of the time, or even that all people are basically good. Clearly we have had some rotten eggs. But that does not mean we are essentially evil, selfish things. Easily misled, perhaps, but not inherently bad. On an individual level, people are capable of great caring and impressive acts of selflessness.
I believe that the wearing of the school uniform should be encouraged because it reminds each child that they are equal (at least in school). It also shows unity and children feel included and it helps them to work as a team.
It is better to have a lousy father than to be fatherless because you will have someone there to learn mistakes from and to give you motivation to do better. You'll never have that question in your mind of what it would've been like to have a father.
Not at all. These people need to be stopped before they hurt a child. If you are worried go back to the chat room and ask what they do to keep you safe. I don't think you can be traced by the paedo though because of data protection. If you are still worried, contact the police and explain the situation and say that you are worried about it. They will do everything they can to keep you safe.
What does that mean?Companies can advertise that their products are better than their competitors' products. They are even encouraged to use images of their competitors' products in their ads. This encourages competition and as long as they aren't intentionally trying to confuse people, fair use protects such use of trademarks and copyrights.By the way, there is no such thing as truth in advertisement so no evidence is required to make such claims.Edit: The legal departments of most companies won't let them make libelous ads. There's a difference between saying "Product A is better than product B" and "Company A is better than company B because they kill young children and then eat them".
The service was very good or I might have marked this lower. The food was super expensive and boring. The sliders I got weren't cooked all of the way through and the buns were greasy. Other than the service I did like the fries. I would order the fries and sit at the bar as the service was great but would not order the sliders again.
Porn is anything but wrong in most cases. Sometimes it's in very bad taste, but when it's giving equal gratification, etc. to all parties, there's nothing wrong, and I could even consider it an art form in some respects.
I think that school uniform is a good idea. First it's make students look nice and tidy. Second we can know that who is study in which school or who is in a same school with us and finally it's convenient because we don't have to spend to much of time to choose clothes to school
can be recycled to make other things. like more water bottles. it also makes the water companys rich. theyre not expensive, its like 3 bucks for one of those big packs at shaws. that will keep you un-thirsty for a couple weeks for pocket change.
Yes, because who knows if they will turn on you and than one night that you less expect it they will try to kill you because its on their mind that you know the truth and the truth cant get out and they need to get rid of all types of clues even of those they love just incase they try to talk to someone.
I believe that personal pursuit is better because one must themselves happy before they can go out into the world and try to make everyone else happy. If you try to make everyone else happy and you leave no time for you, then you become a wreak and then you have no happiness in your life. Some people find that helping others is their own pursuit of happiness.
I believe that personal pursuit is better because in order to help others you have to help yoursel first. I also think that if you are happy with yourself and enjoy helping others you have the confidence and strength to help the outside world while satisfying yourself. For example, someone wants to succeed in life and through that he achieves his goals, whenever he is already succesful and with money he decides to help others.
The emotional part of me supports the death penalty...i know if someone killed a family member i would want them to face the ultimate punishment.But the rational and prevailing part of me opposes the death penalty because of the risk of innocent people being killed. People think DNA is the killsafe...it is not..not all cases involve DNA and those convicted before the use of DNA often cannot get appeals to have the test performed. So oppose it, lest I or someone I know faces the fate of the unknown amount of innocents sentenced to death.
Can they sue you even if you are outside the US?  Yes.Can they sue you even if they cannot find you?  Yes.  The court will give them permission to advertise the case in the newspaper in the area where they think you are.So, if you don't show up in thesuit you don't know about can they win a judgment?  Yes.But now they have a judgment in a US court for US money.  How will they enforce the judgment?  If they can find assets of yours like bank accounts in the US, they can sieze those.  But if all of your money is outside the country (actually, even outside the state where the suit was brought) it is going to be a nightmare for them to collect the money.  I mean, they'll have to take the judgment to a foreign court and have it translated and it'll just be a mess.So you're probably safe.  Not 100% definitely safe but about 87% pretty much safe.
Race shouldn't even be a factor within a "diverse" community. Regardless of race everyone is still unique. Nobody should have to feel like they're just like everyone else because of their race.No two people are alike. Everyone is born with different interests, beliefs, and physical characteristics. Now, I'm not saying it's alright to purposely exclude members of different races, but they should not have to be integrated into communities of one race in order to make it more "diverse". Moreover, even within a single race there are numerous differences in appearance and skin colour. Race really shouldn't matter that much.
I honestly think that Fascism can be a positive and good thing for a nation and it's people if it is done correctly with a great leader such as FDR, obviously it doesn't work with horrible people like Hitler or Mussolini but what about Hideki Tojo, in my opinion he was a pretty good leader with his people's hopes in front of him, only to make bad choices by supporting the Axis. Though he still knew when it was time to give up and even stopped causing the blood of his people to be shed after seeing the destruction of the Atomic Bomb. So what would happen if Fascism still existed, with a competent and great leader in control? My opinion, is that it would become prosperous.
Dark Knight is a grand epic, but Year One’s strength is in its subtleties. It’s more crime comic then a superhero tale, where Batman fights dirty cops and the mob with few gadgets (and no Robin). Mazzuchelli’s realistic art matches the mood perfectly. Batman looks like an athlete in a rental costume, not a bodybuilder in body paint. Miller writes Bruce Wayne as less revenge driven and more noble in motivation. My only complaint is that they should have made more than four issues.
I'll start off by saying that this was my first time at a Tim Horton's and had heard good things.  We went for breakfast before our train back to the States.  I had the BELT (Bacon, Egg, Lettuce, Tomato) on a pretzel bagel.  The bagel did not taste fresh and the eggs could barely be found.  My girlfriend had the bacon, egg and cheese on an English muffin.  This thing was TINY and would have made an Egg McMuffin look big.Somehow they ran out of hash browns but didn't realize it until after we paid.  They offered us a doughnut instead but we didn't want that. The coffee was so hot that you couldn't hold the cup more than 10 seconds.  Because that we had to throw it out.  We were  already delayed and had to catch a train so we chalked it up as a loss.
I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.
In my opinion, I strongly agree that parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children because the spankings are painful enough for children to learn to avoid doing the wrong things.
The concept that people have this *right* is an ethical question and I support the position that all have this right.Whether people actually have it is a legal question based on the laws of their country. China, for example, has government policies in place that restrict the information the inhabitants can freely receive.In India, there are domestic rights organizations that are vigilant in protecting and preserving the citizens perceived rights including that of information. (1)Every country has a segment that would restrict information and any of the other qualities that are considered *rights*. Regardless of political party there are essentially two kinds of people; those who wish controls and those who do not want controls.
Every one has the right to have his own opinions, to be open about ‘em and to speak out loud his own thoughts, logical or not, you also have the right to listen to that person or not, to come back with your own ideas and opinions or to simply neglect him like if he doesn’t exist (of course if his ideas aren’t logical or acceptable)…It is a kind of oppression to define to people the way they should think and express themselves.
I actually believe that uniforms are good and in schools should be school uniforms. In this situation you don't have to constantly worry about what you're gonna wear every morning. And for it time you will be do any important thing which help to you in lessons. Yes, it might be a little boring putting on the same set of clothes but it's less costly this way, and you do not have to go on shopping trips so regularly.
Having a Lousy father would be better than being fatherless. If you have a Lousy father you can look at his mistakes, and avoid them. Also being fatherless would be hard on you and your mom. You would have no example or any kind of person to look up to. If you need help, at least you have your father there to lend you a hand, even if he is lousy.
I think parents should not spank because there's other way to make them behave.
Personally i think that if you are not helping yourself you cant help no one else. If you try to help every person that needs your help, they will just slow you down. Don't get me wrong helping people is always right. In the big picture if you pursuit your dreams and get rich, fame, and power you will be able to help the people that matter to you.
IE7 on Vista supports protected mode which runs the browser in a security context that has minimal access to your computer and private information. Both Firefox and IE are internet facing apps with occasional security issues, so I prefer the browser with better security architecture.
I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.
It might be against the teachings of the bible etc... but only because a gay relationship bears no offspring which is why it was banned.Also it was seen to weaken the position of men.Time have changed... its time to accept.
The death penalty is not revenge.  Instead that, it is the punishment assigned a person after having been found guilty of a crime by a jury of his peers.There are laws that determine what crimes and under what circumstances a person may be eligible for the death penalty if he is convicted.  This may not be a matter of "revenge" by the state - but might felt so by the victims' family.  Finding an individual guilty and later putting him to death provides a form of closure for the victim's family.. In some states, most prisoners only get life imprisonment without any opportunity for parole.
Animal testing should be allowed (under strict conditions) until there is a viable alternative that is as cheap and effective as animal testing. Those strict conditions should include: a suitable habitat for the animal, a decent diet, no cruel treatment, and only for certain, specified diseases or malaises. They should not use animal testing for products such as make-up or perfume, but if they are testing a drug that may be a cure for cancer, animal testing is possibly the best route to take, as it is cheap and yet one of the most effective tests available.
your argument doesn't hold validity since in the cases you sited, the mental stability and ability to reason are completely compromised. The state intervenes in the cases in instances of mental illness.You will need to find a better answer. Sorry. Try again.
I believe politicians don't have the knowledge and know-how on how to run a country. We seen over and over again multiple cases of corruption, bankrupcy all over the world, and country failing to maintain a positive economy. Most of the solutions come from an assembly where  politicians reunite and discuss those solutions. Most of the time they fail to implement a good one.In the early 1900s there was a movement called Technocracy movement which wanted to replace politicians with engineers and scientists specialized in each area they running (e.g education would be run by someone connected to it that has spent a majority of her life studying education)I believe our politic system isn't been run like it should.

This argument is very close to me at the moment, an ex-friend of mine who is 17 years old has had unprotected sex with a minor of whom is not even totally "developed" yet.He sees no wrong in what he is doing even though he is:a. Breaking the law.b. Aware he is breaking the lawc. Proud of it.Personally, I think that it is not all that hard to wait until you are 16, after all, if teens are sexually active at such a young age, it could cause such problems as teenage pregnancy, STD's and even permanent damage to their bodies.I personally see it as a foul thing, for people often regret it when they are older, it can cause irreperable mental and physical damage and is simpy morally wrong.I'm not one that support no sex before marriage, but sex before you even really know what it is, is a different story.
This piece is a call to action in the UK to put a stop to the governments big brother program. Londons Westimister Council are further compounding the problem that people don't trust the government and their surveillance of British people by taking away something that most people love and want to keep.Additionally, Banksy has made what was once a boring ugly wall something interesting, engaging and poignant. He is a celebrated artist in his own right and Westiminster Council should recognise this piece as a gift to be embraced rather than erased.
Slow service , too expensive , weird chairs with wheels on. I ordered a selection of Sashimi which tasted OK but not worthy of the price tab. Also had a beef noodle dish , very mediocre small amount of beef with huge lumps of tofu. Wine is $13 a glass! 6 of us ate there , nothing extravagant 2 wines , 2 beers $174 before tip. Yikes. Don't bother.
Worst buffet I've ever been to.  I preferred the $5.99 China Buffet I tried once.  Food was very bland, selection was small, salads were wilted, no sign of vegetables anywhere, gravy was congealed and the "roast beef" was the size of my fist and then they slice off 2 paper thin slices for you.  Also was extremely overpriced at $19 on a Tuesday night.  Better off going to Mandarin.
Usually my decision in the end is yes and no,or goes both ways. Today, however it is advancing for the common good. Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help yourself and other people. If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.
Murder under any circumstance is not right. A person who commits the act knows the consequences, and they know that they are guilty. I wouldn't be able to look at my spouse the same ever again. I would not be able to live with the secret of a murder.So yea, i would turn them in.
I heard about this on the news this morning. IMO, he had a choice whether or not to perform the act that resulted in the baby. Even if she says she is on birth control, or he uses a condom, it does not matter. The only 100% safe birth control is not to do it. So if he went ahead with the act and she accidently got pregnant, he is just as responsible as she is.On the other hand, if she intentionally got pregnant, and knew he had no desire to have a child, then he may have a case. But that will probably be hard to prove. I also agree that the child should not be punished or suffer because of this, but neither should the father.But this is just my opinion.
I often see criticisms of the use of burqas and other pieces of clothing meant to cover up Muslim women. I have read countless online discussions and seen many television debates/newscasts critiquing the role of burqas within the Muslim religion. However, nobody seems to acknowledge that the west does the exact same thing with breasts.In most places, women must cover up their breast in public, websites consider it nudity and will censor these videos/images, and even if it is legal, it is often frowned down on by the public. We have sexualized breasts and therefore have forbidden them from being exposed publicly, how is this different from preventing women from exposing their faces or legs?I invite you all to CMV.
Currently, I am just curious and possibly wondering about the perceptions of evil or bad people. When I think of people that the USA (Yes, I am American) consider bad, my mind trends toward Putin, Osama bin Laden, and other people that oppose capitalism and western ideas. In the media and in schools, we are taught that these people are evil, but I don't think that the people that we consider evil wake up every morning and say,"Hey, I really think it is time for me to be evil, because I love being evil." I feel like these people may have ulterior motives or just a different opinion on the perception and actions of situations. ThanksEdit: Edit spelling
Hardly a day goes by without a democrat politician bemoaning the fact that we have not captured/killed Osama bin Laden. Yes, capturing or killing this man would be a great accomplishment. However, removing bin Laden from the planet would do little or nothing to stop terrorism. Terrorists, even islamic ones in Indonesia would likely not be impressed by the death of a single man.
I'm not saying it should be english, but there should be one official language we use to communicate with each other.We would be able to do business much better, understand everyone, and communicate ideas properly. The internet has given us all the ability to communicate with each other, all we need now is the same language.I'm not saying destroy other languages, but it would be nice to have one official one.
If he prescribed the meds, he bears the legal responsibility, but it's possible that he doesn't actually have access to the records.  Whatever the case, your access to your medical records are guaranteed by federal law.  Whoever owned the facility would be responsible for maintaining those records.  In general, I agree with these other guys.  He knows he's in trouble and he's trying to weasel out.  Strongarm him.
I think the birth mother should have the right for "no contact." There could, however, be an intermediary who could be contacted in the event of a medical emergency.Women need to have this safeguard so they won’t feel pressured by the judgemental spirits of others about their unwanted pregnancy. It’s very sad that abortions are frequently chosen because of these reasons.
Yeah, it is. A religious debate accomplishes nothing. rather insults are passed and one side or the other is seriously ganged against and belittled for their personal beliefs. Nobody will actually change their beliefs because somebody quotes scientific or Biblical 'evidence' that may or may not exist or be a firm as is made sound.Furthermore, speaking for both sides, both have faults and apparent oppenings of unexplained, so each side will just pick eachother apart as able.
Went in on a Monday night. There were several servers there however, none came to even take our drink order for 15 minutes so we left. Manager came by at one point and asked how we were doing as he walked by but he asked and kept walking. Why ask how I'm doing if you clearly don't care or want to know why which is evidenced by the pace of your gate around the restaurant. Mind boggling!
