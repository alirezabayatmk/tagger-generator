Books enlighten the soul. Books don't destroy the morals of children. Books throw the mind into a series of questions, they take the readers to mystical places, paradise, and even the kitchen sink. They change your perspective on life and often give the reader a sense of relativity. Television is like a drug. It's as bad as nicotine. Fahrenheit 451, the Night Circus, The Secret Garden, Inkheart... Do I have to further explain..?
I am a nurse and the more I studied biology, the more I was in awe of the miracle of our bodies. Every tiny cell has it's own design that is even more complex than a computer. When you look at a computer do you question that there had to be a creator? Or do you need proof that this highly organized machine came to be about by a mere accident or order of circumstances? Evolutionists need more faith than Creationists.
The government has no place to tell a woman what she can do with her own body, ever.The government DOES have that right.1) a woman cannot legally prostitute herself in many states2) a woman cannot take illicit drugs into her own body3) a woman cannot use her body to murder others4) a woman cannot use her body to steal5) a woman cannot display her naked body in publicthere are many others. Men can also not do these things.The government tells us what to do with our bodies ALL THE TIME. This is no different.
I am Pro-Life,Here is a question for anyone who is Pro-Choice: Is the baby in the mother's stomach living and if not how do you know?
I feel that its totally against everything that is American. How about everyone straps a GPS system to their legs so the government knows where everyone is, oops that's right cell phones i almost forgot. Besides this the government is saying its all in public safety, but i dont kno how safe i feel if i know someone is listening to my phone calls. Give me a break if i wanted to blow some shit up I wouldn't talk on the phone to make plans for it anyway.
In one sense you bring up an interesting point.  Let me challenge you with a broader concept......do our Laws reflect our Morality....or does Morality stem from the Laws we make each other abide by?In their written series of civilization, Will and Ariel Durant made the point in the first book, "Our Oriental Heritage", that man did not need or make laws until he thought his neighbor needed them.Think on that a bit as you ponder your own question.In my own personal opinion, I do believe that faith can and should inform public policy.  In a republic such as ours, we have agreed to abide by the majority, until a new majority comes into being.  And each new majority will bring its' own set of values.
First of all, very first of all, us people are very greedy. We like to scrimp if we can, so we can pocket the difference. $8B, according to Forbes is its budget. If it was so useless, or even if Congress felt they could get away without it, they would immediately remove it. $8B more! They'd raise their pay! But they don't. Why wouldn't they? Because they think it serves some sort of purpose, and I am assuming it is the one of protecting the USA. Secondly, it is evolving. You have seen new security measures every year and while yes, they are annoying, they may have potentially saved your life. How's that for throwing away 500ml of water and standing in queue for 30min?I can see that many people in reddit disagree with this, however, and I want to know why, so I can form a balanced opinion. So CMV!
Yes, it WILL recover - PROVIDED the government stops its meddling and 'bailing out' measures. It's things exactly like this that turned the potentially temporary market drop into a huge and horrid 'Great Depression'......and as part of the 'measures' then instituted were some of the Union Laws which are STILL crippling our ability to be competitive....I wish lawmakers HAD TO take at least SOME relevant history while in high school...
Since this place is close to where i live and it showed good yelp ratings i figured i would give it a try.  Went to try the veal sandwich and check out their baked goods. Veal sandwich - 2.5 stars. The veal wasn't tender enough which made it difficult to bite through. I added provolone and onions which was decent, but the onions were sliced pretty big. The tomato sauce was liquidy which makes me think there isn't enough tomato paste. This made the sandwich more soggy than tasty. Baked goods - 2 stars. I can't comment on the taste since i just checked it out but a handful of the items looked familiar from other bakeries which makes me think that they don't bake onsite. Also there was a lot of condensation build up in one of the cake/cookie fridge which make the food look unappetizing. The only things that looked worth trying was the lemon meringue and the cannolis.Final thoughts - was hoping for way better but got less than mediocre. Won't be trying out again.
Just a note to the creationists. Please use the "Convinced me" link correctly.You're supposed to click this if the person's argument convinced you that Creationism is true. Some of you seem to be clicking anything and everything on the right hand side.This will not help you win the debate by the way.
Whoever said porn degrades women is idiotic. #1 They get compensated well, #2 they CHOSE to do it, #3 some girls actually like what they do, #4 without sex and porn, you may not have been born. Sex = life. =)
This debate has clarified for me that the government shouldn't really be in the marriage business.  Let the churches perform marriages for whomever they think fit, and let the government simply record the marraiges or civil unions and grant equal rights to them all.  As for plural "marriages,"  they exist, but there is not a sizable part of the population which supports them.  That is a different debate for another day, and the issues are quite different.  In my mind, the purpose of marriage or civil union is to provide support to individuals, especially when they are raising children.  Some of the most monogamous couples I know are gay, and they are some of the best parents too.
I had the oppertunity to visit Dar just a couple of weeks back.  And to answer each of your questions separately may be difficult for me.  But maybe my observations while I was in Dar may help you find some answers to your questions.First and foremost, what I felt is that there is general feeling of detachment in the general public.  There is hardly any enthusiasm in whatever they are doing and have a tendency to just follow, whatever they are told.  There is great amount od tired, laid back approach to work and things can take forever to acomplish.I am sure Tz as a country has lot of potential, but if you ask me my opinion as an outsider if Tz can develop into an exemplary country, my response would Yes, but there is long way to go and a lot to change before that.
HAHAHA! It's not going to happen.People are free to make there own decisions in life. Yeah, maybe it sucks that there is such big consequences to it, but really you sound stupid! Sex should not be taught as an evil thing. It's not evil or dirty.  Maybe you should teach your kids about responsiblity and learn to talk to them about it. Jails are over crowded now. Imagine what it would be like if ppl are thrown into jail because of that. You can't stop nobody from doing what they want to do. You should know that already from when you where younger. The more you discouage it the more they are going to want to do it. People have that right. Yes, even kids. That's the only way they learn.
The establishment of Israel is often cited as necessary based on the need to protect people of Jewish heritage from around the world. To the victors go the spoils. Why should an Israeli state be established in a historically relevant but highly dangerous location because of an historical claim that is thousands of years old? Why not annex a portion of Germany, relocate a population whose government actively worked to destroy the Jews, and work towards acceptance of Jewish visitors in their Holy Land? I am very aware that not all Germans were complicit in the actions of the Nazis. However, the annexation of a portion of Germany is arguably more morally justifiable than basically conquering Palestine because of a religion-based claim. If Jewish security is the issue, lopping off a portion of Germany to form Neo-Israel would have been the vastly superior option. CMV.
Coors light tastes like beer-flavored piss-water. Labatts tastes like a pond that 80-year-old canucks had sex in. Budweiser is for retards who don't know what beer is. But Yuengling is mass produced and... actually pretty good. It's not the *best* beer, mind you. It's *good*, but it's not like, king of beers or anything. Craft brews are getting a lot of attention in recent years, especially in America, and a lot of beer snobs go to parties. These guys are not easy to please, but they *will* settle for Yuengling. It's just good enough to not offend, and just shitty enough to please the unwashed plebs. Change my view.
Anything intelligence created by a more intelligent being is artificial correct? The creating being is the "real" being, while it's creation is an imitation of itself. That means if anything we create is artificial, we ourselves are artificial intelligence.....if we were created. If we have rights and need to respect one another, does that mean we should have love and compassion for our creations? Would it be possible to love something we have given artificial intelligence? If not, how can god love me or you?
"Nothing exists." To utter that sentence - or even contemplate it - applies existence to something that is "nothing." Yet to argue that nothing exists asserts - paradoxically - that in fact, no thing exists. It is a logical impossibility to argue that nothing does not exist. Therefore, we must apply existence to nothing - making nothing something indeed!
As we know that India is fully filled with corruption. Each and every person have no time to help others, his only aim is to earn money in any way.Our manners and civilization are reducing and reducing every day.
That's your best argument - "Because they don't" ?I thought there was a reason for everything...I don't see the squirrel outside my window evolving. In fact, I'm pretty sure squirrels have looked and acted the same for thousands of years.How does an animal aquire a trait that he wasn't born with? Does he just wish for it really hard and it magically grows?And you proved my point - "species have certain characteristics and properties"I noticed you didn't mention that their characteristics randomly changeAnd by the way, I'm just wondering because I'm a curious person...what insects are you talking about?
Yes! and yes and yes and definately a god damn bloody yes.Lack of physical education is the reason why your aunt or uncle is in hospital.Lack of physical education is the reason why millions of people are fat.Lack of physical education is the reason why you cannot sleep properly at times.Lack of physical education is the reason why you are not having super great sex with your girlfriend(s)
this is my big problem with christianity: why is it about belief. there have been horrible people who are believers. what about wonderful people who do great things for the world and are atheists. is it fair to punish them for not knowing what the nature od reality is??? I AM an atheist and im a good person. the idea that a mere belief difference can seal ones fate is beyond preposterous, its madness!!
Gay Marriage. I'm an agnostic so in no way does my religion conflict with this matter. I'm an avid gay rights supporter. Marriage, is said to be the marriage of 2 people who love and care about each other. Some Straight couples just get married for the benefit of getting kids. So is that right in any case? What is the purpose of marriage if 2 people only get married to reap its benefits? I.e Have kids? As we are living in a developing society, more and more and more people are coming to terms and agreeing that gay marriage is ok.
It sounds to me like you have big trouble. CASA - that's Community Alternate Systems Agency - is staffed with Registered Nurses and makes determinations about Medicaid eligibility. If you took your child to a doctor or an ER and someone saw what they took for signs of abuse (bruises, etc.) they are bound by law to make a report. If it has nothing to do with that, they may just be trying to determine if you qualify for Medicade.  Being bureaucrats, they have a tendency to stick their noses into everyone's business.
First of all, the Constitution does NOT guarantee the "pursuit (or persuit) of happiness".  That expression appears in the preamble to the Declaration of Independence.  On substance, I doubt very much time and energy is spent in enforcing laws relating to prostitution in relation to other offenses. Finally, will you admit to any role for morality in criminal law?  I mean, take laws relating to age of consent -- why is consensual sex illegal for, say, 15 year olds but not 16 year olds?  In other words, how do you draw a line?
Because they haven't thought through it properly. Just like the rest of us (including, no doubt, you), many of their opinions are a mix of other peoples opinions. The result is an inconsistent view (also note opinions on the death penalty). It is almost impossible to think through EVERY issue for yourself because there are so many.In many cases it could be conservatism is masquarading as pro-life. They are not the same thing. Conservatism says whatever we used to do is right. Pro-life says that every human life is worth more than anything.On the other hand, pro-choice could be called inconsistent. Just as an a parent may believe their life would be better if the foetus didn't exist, the U.S. may feel it more convenient if the nation of Iraq is a bloody mess.Every unheard voice of every oppressed person, whether in Iraq or in the womb, is worth defending.
Instruments have such wild limitations compared To a normal composition programs that I think they're obsolete in the modern musical world. They have imperfection, and you cant control the frequencies of the sounds you're making as well. People will spend years learning how to make a single sound, instead of all possible sounds. When you play an instrument, you're just a drone, an atomaton playing someone else's piece. It's like being a soldier vs being the president. Sure, it takes a lot of work, but it's a waste of talent.
This is influenced by the IAmA submission from the guy who proudly kills fellow human beings in the name of "saving" wildlife. But really? How are poachers more morally and ecologically irresponsible than hunters? Hunters have been responsible for the extinction of wildlife in recent memory and in past events of human existence. Hunters, just like poachers, threaten animal for the sake of profit. Anti pouching initiative is hypocrisy in itself. One, it does not make the existence of mankind better. Two, it doesn't stop the extinction of various species in wildlife at the hands of human beings.
Was very disappointed with this place.  Been going to a ramen place down the street for a while and always leave full and happy.... came here after hearing all the hype about pho and wasnt happy.  i totally would pick ramen over pho any day!!!!the egg rolls were very good and that was the only good thing about the dinner!
Have any of you noticed that those who are against books are the ones who have terrible arguments. Like that person who just said TV is awesome with many exclamation marks and in capitals. That clearly proves that books are much better than TV because it TV rots the brain.
The scientific rigor you mention is not present in evolutionary theory. Here's one example: In the 1800s, Charles Lyell and others came up with dates for the rock strata. Radiometric dating wasn't invented until the 1900s. When it was invented, the techniques were calibrated to match the dates Lyell came up with. To say that this proves the dates that Lyell came up with is a logical fallacy, and it sure doesn't sound like true scientific rigor to me.
All these arguments about that porn leads to addiction are annoying me now -_- . Porn hardly ever leads to addiction, just in weak people, maybe who have mental health issues, or attachment issues or find it hard to separate fantasy from reality. I watch porn once or twice a day when i'm on my own but also have a great boyfriend and we have sex once or twice (sometimes three, if i'm lucky!) times a week, we use porn to spice things up in the bedroom but we know it's all fantasy, we're not idiots, we just have desires that need to be met!
I wouldn't live my life right if I never got to meet my father. I wouldn't care if I grew up and had lousy father even if he has no job or life and maybe even an alcohlic. Having a father means alot especially if your boy because most fathers are friends to, so you can talk to them about guy problems and they would understand the situation and with just living with your mother you couldn't because she's a woman and her views are different then a guy. Whether its a good or lousy father they will always be there for you at sometime in life.
god aint flipppin real, so get over it u dumb belivers of god
Answer is NO! However, I think the bigger problem is finding out who leaks this information, there are a lot of Clinton era hold-overs.Newspapers are in the business of bashing Bush, so they will do whatever it takes to hinder the war effort, and then hide behind freedom of the press. It is getting people killed, and prolonging the war by telling our enemy everything they need to know.
It's boring. Kind of scary. I am not going to complain about the regular sex.shower time could get right out of hand.seriously it is a drag. Psychiatric wards can be scarier, but you don't necessarily have to sleep with guys if you are broke and need a smoke, lot's of good looking loonies(I can say that I own that word) in the hospital and you cannot catch crazy so it is worth going for it.So each has it's pros and con's but I would have to recommend psyche ward over jail. and jail over my last marriage.oh for the people that say you lose your self respect, speak for yourselfs. i am just dandy.
The schools are teaching kids learned helplessness.  It only causes the true victims of the school to suffer at the hands of administration.  The current "Stop Bullying" campaign is propaganda to keep kids from recognizing themselves as autonomous beings and is a key reason why there are more school shootings.  When you back an animal into a corner, it will strike with full force.  That is what the school system and laws in place do.  I also believe the laws in place are turning kids into people who can't solve problems on their own.
Oh lol. People to point this out believing in God is called "faith" and we don't need proof to deal with this atheist's. The idea of God is false is your own words, and I don't have to deal with this , whatever you think is your faith so we won't stop you. Both side contradicts each others belief and no one truthfully wins. This is probably a fight between two armies where both doesn't win until the end. Mainly , I support Christianity because of my "faith to God" and your proof that God doesn't exist doesn't change the case or turn it the other way around.
It must not be mandatory, but at least a requirements but not more often. How would you consider PE if the child is not so well? And if possible separate boys from girls, for boys assign some good games of physical education activity to them, same thing with girls, give them games for girls ideas.
Gay marriage bans, along with other laws, are only in place because of the religious right that seems to be infecting this country. The UNITED States of America can only remain united if laws are created with all men and women in mind. To have a law that favors one religion, or lack thereof, over another is the bane of freedom. Secular law is the only law that works.Leviticus 20:13: "If a man lies with mankind as he does with womankind, they are both commiting an abomination, they shall be put to death, their blood is on their own hands."There's a loving god, eh?
The deal is: "Freedom of speech goes both ways"People not only have a right to say pretty much what they want, other people have a right to object, argue & even ask for an apology. A liberal says something, a conservative objects & the conservative is bashed for 'violating a person's freedom of speech.' A conservative says something, a liberal objects, and conservatives either let it drop there or defend the original statement on its merit.So who is really against freedom of speech;The conservative who asks a liberal for an apology for an offensive statement, or the liberal who acts like you aren't allowed to express the fact your offended by a statement?
Capital punishment is simply the best law enforcement out there. Ask any country that has employed it. You'll find that their crime rates are MUCH lower than the USA's. This only applies if the nation is comfortable with it of course. On the other hand, its immoral for a man to take another's life no matter what the situation since you are assuming a position of superiority when you do so and every man on the earth is equal. Despite its effectiveness, there are multiple other alternatives to it and capital punishment should not be a first choice.Its simply a matter of perspective in the end.The typical christian perspective goes against capital punishment and thats due to this christian country. The simple truth is that its effective but at the same time, from a biased perspective, its barbaric, immoral, and there are better, though not as effective, solutions.
To answer your question and to refute the genius who compared captial punishment to abortion:The fact is, yes, there have been far too many instances where people have been put to death then later found innocent.  Our judicial system needs to put policies in place that will prevent this from EVER happening.  But generally, if a person, without a doubt, has been convicted of a malicious crime, they should be put to death.  How sane is it to allow someone who raped, tortured and killed a young girl to sit in a jail cell and live off taxpayer money?  If that individual feels someone INNOCENT deserves to die, why should they be allowed to live?  Again, I believe there should be WITHOUT a doubt concrete evidence against a person who is put on death row.And concerning abortion...unborn babies have not committed heinous crimes.
Absolutely not. That's when we NEED those freedoms the most.We need to be able to say that "I don't like the way the administration is handling things" without fear of someone putting us in prision. I may not agree with someone else's opinions. But I'll fight to the death, to make sure they can state those opinions.
It has been proven to the satisfaction of many people, but there are some that are extremely hard to convince, for a variety of reasons. These reasons are mainly faith based, in that they have faith in the government, and do not want to believe that their government could murder three thousand of its own citizens. They will all wake up in due time, probably when the country is under Martial law, with curfews imposed, and they become prisoners in their own house.That's for the lucky ones of course. The less lucky will become prisoners in the 600 or so concentration camps which have been built around the country, and are already manned and waiting for their presence.
last time i checked he still has the right to a court appt attorney..until then if you can"t make bail or get a bondsmen then i guess he will have to tough it till his court date.....if he hates it that bad..then maybe he won't make the same mistake again when choosing a girl. We all have our lessons to learn, some get the rough end for seemingly no reason sometimes..but this is life and you can't always come to their rescue.....even when sometimes you feel you need to...grown up problems come with grown up consequences that are sometimes hard to fix. Sorry
In my opinion Nascar is not a sport and should not be considered one. First of all it's about as entertaining as watching cars drive on the highway. I don't know how anybody who can stand to sit in a stadium for several hours in the sun watching cars drive really fast in circles. How the hell is that entertaining. I'd rather watch a cricket game! The drivers don't even have to be in shape. As long as they don't have high blood pressure their bodies can endure. So why does anyone like such a pathetic hobby?
I play guitar and don't feel like I suck. I believe I am quite capable of expressing myself on the instrument. Oh yeah... AND I LOVE GUITAR HERO! It actually helps to improve dexterity and coordination as well as strength and speed.P.S. Can people try and spell a little better at least with the titles of the debates. I mean, come on, they let ya know when you've misspelled a word. Although whoever created this one spelled the word correctly. They just typed the completely wrong word.
In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus, and I think we all know that a lot of men consider lesbians to be downright sexy, because there is no man in the picture to ruin the aesthetic. (Vice versa for gay men.)Additionally, gay women are more "socially acceptable," for one of the traditional reasons behind homophobia: women are inferior to men.Gay men are discriminated against because they have no honor: romantic interest in men is for women only, and when an man participates he is "lowering himself" to a women's level.Gay women, on the other hand, are discriminated against less because romantic interest in women is a man's attribute, giving them honor.(The preceding is not my opinion, but instead my rather cynical interpretation of modern society)
I have lots of gay friends. I'm all for it!People should stop being so against it. People can't help it. I've watched shows about it and I can really see how gay people feel.. when people are looking at them and some of them feel like they are being watched. It is just not right. We are all human.
Thats just liberal ignorance. A criminal will find a way, be it a gun, knife, baseball bat...It's just "feel good" legislation. Makes the liberals think they are doing something to combat crime (while letting the criminals run rampant)Statistics show that criminals do less when up against a well-armed citizen. (And crime rates drop). And for the record, the second amendment is there, not to protect our hunting rights, but to allow us to have the ability to fight back against a governement that goes out of control. And hunting rifles against machine guns isn't an even matchup.
We've got a bunch of Good Ole' Boys up there scratching each others' backs, making a living off of us and turning it into a career. Need to enact term limits of no longer than two terms in both House and Senate. Get those 80-yr old geysers outa there. They've already earned their lifetime pension and benefits.Good people go to D.C. with good intentions, but they can't do anything by themselves. So in order to get their Bills passed, they have to help pass someone else's Bill that is established there and knows how the system works; the Good Ole' Boy System, that is. The Good Ole' Boys are just biding their time, keeping their system going and blocking everything else. They work for themselves. All incumbents -- OUT!
How can it not?Inside they have their own laws, and I do not mean prison laws.To live you obey them, if not you could very well end up dead.It is sad to say but some of our prisons are run by the gangs inside them.The prisoners behind bars have it so good any more that prison is no deterrent to crime at all.
i think black ppl give more of a bad name!...only bcuz more then half of all jails are black ppl and u barely c white people on tv when anything bad happins! u mostly see rappers who r black go to jail for some stupid stuff and u nevr c any country singers that r white go anywhere bad!..im not sayin white ppl arent bad to cuz there are things that go on with them to but its all mostly black ppl!!...i think all monkeys and krackers shouldcreated equaly....but seperatly!
Unless you want security to manhandle your fiancé don't go here.  I don't care if Tiesto or Calvin Harris is playing here it is a joke. Security should protect their guests, not make it more difficult and/or hurt them.  My fiancé had a bruise on her arm and soar for a few days.  Way to have a 300lb security guard push a shove/grab a 120lb woman in heals, hope your ego is soaring.  And btw we hadn't had a drink yet.
Well "The Champ" It is not the Woman's body we are talking about, it is a new life. And if you are going to be irresponsible dont let a new life die for it!
a number of reasons..because the girls are out looking for a good time with guys in perhapes the wrong places--ie the bar or disco or late night partiesbecause guys are  "lacing" drinks with drugs quite easily because the media portrays "a good time" for young people  as" having sex"and uncool to go without it because girls dont think their safety is their priority anymore and if parents try to warn them they react by going all out with guys giving them the opportunity they are looking forbecause the "safety antena" of girls arent as sensitive as they should be to keep them from becoming a victimthus date rape is a consequence of all these factors. so girls need to take care, be aware of your own safety dont give "strange" guys the upperhand if you dont want to be date raped..
The conversation can not be used as evidence in a court of law.  I don't know what the lady hoped to gain from recording the conversation other than to create more drama.  Some people are hooked on drama and they actually do what they can to create it.  Run as far away and as fast as you can from these types.  They will suck you dry.
NO.Whoever made the first 'response' is a prime example of how powerful propaganda is.I don't ever remember hearing of a VALID case that had anything to do with the use of marijuana and someone being violent, much less some killing spree. Regardless of what the government provides as services for those who are ill, it shouldn't have the right to totally ban the use of certain substances. ESPECIALLY when those substances are LESS harmful than the ones that are legal!Wake up guys! NEWSFLASH: You can die by drinking too much water! Just because you'll get help from a hospital or whatever doesn't mean they should ban water.Where is your logic guys?Also to those who whine about it being a gateway drug:If it wasn't illegal, it wouldn't be a gateway drug.It's made bad only by the hypocritical efforts of the government and the gullible people that trust their efforts.
Even when the sentence was ridiculous to begin with?  Non-violent drug offenders, who need rehab, not warehousing with real criminals, have often been given longer sentences than violent criminals.  I spent years working to get a woman paroled from a 20 year sentence for possessing 2/3rds of a gram.  And even though she betrayed me when she got out, and caused me deep hurt, I still do not believe it was fair that she was in as long as she was.
i don't know where you're getting the idea they make tons of money from putting kids in foster care.  it COSTS the state tons of money.  my sister does this for a living and their departements are severly underfunded and understaffed.  the workers do what they can but sadly, until everyone gets it through to their local officals that they want money spent on protecting abused children instead of tax cuts and expanding roads the situation is not going to improve.  it's really sad.  my sister alone has about 50 cases and she's sposued to visit the foster home, the parents, supervise at least 1 visit and go to court monthly for each of them.  there's just not enough hours in a day.  each caseworker should only have about 20 cases but they don't have the funding to hire enough people.  i hope your situation works out.
I think that could be a contributing factor. Plus, our media doesn’t show all the true horrors of war: refugees, dead soldiers, grieving families, etc. And the thousands of other grotesque nuances that cannot be translated well into media form, like the mental anguish, etc.So, having a war on our own land could give Americans a taste of their own medicine. It’s easy to grow complacent when it isn’t your children being blown to pieces, your town left in ruins or your legs being blown off.That why I cannot comprehend why people verbally attack people like Cindy Sheehan. How can you question her motives if you are not in her shoes? Only a coward would attack a parent of a brave soldier that died believing he was protecting his family and country.
I enjoyed his briefing today. It is clear that he understands that he is taking hits by being compared to Bush's Katrina as far as this oil spill goes and understands the Sestak issue will have to be dealt with, whereas before, I don't think he or anyone else took it very seriously. What bothers me is that he took 77,000 from BP, yet directs the corruption between politics and oil companies being the problem. However, that cozy relationship was established long before he got into office. This problem has existed since before Carter was in office, so for him to keep pointing fingers at Bush is irresponsible.
Let me start by defining what Wrestling should be:Wrestling is the act of physical engagement between two UNHARMED persons, in which each wrestler strives to get an advantage over or control over the other.Are we seeing this on television? No!The definition above clearly contradicts what is happening on television today. Many persons can testify of seeing men and women using chairs, bats etc as weapons which means that they are harmed!The violent approach of some of the wrestlers are terrible, i can remember clearly the ' UNDERTAKER' putting a rope around his opponent's neck while the steel cage was going up and it hung him. What a terrible sight!.....
Matthew 5:18:"For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled." Unless Im missing something Heaven, and Earth are still in existance, and not all the prophetic events listed in the Scriptures have happend. I open with these words from the Messiah Yahushua himself, and take him at his word as he is no liar. I realize my post is not in a question format, but this is my opening statement in support of my vote/view on the question posed...The Torah/Law is forever!
All we can say is a big IF because we are not yet 100% sure if this nation itself could lead the whole world. Who knows maybe in the future that India could fail to lead us. There are still other countries who are more progressive, more literated, more powerful than India, like the USA, United Kingdom, Russia, Japan, etc. This nation doesn't have yet enought potentials and ability to sustain the needs of the people. India is not yet that full of technologies like in the Americas. Well in fact technology is one of the most sophisticated and essential inventions ever created.
This not only degrades morality, it also affects how women are treated in society today. This is against women empowerment in a sense that women are viewed merely as sex toys. Which at the end of the day affects how men perceive women which will in turn lead to a lot of disrespect and false perception.Now, how about crime rates? Murders, Rape, and Sexual Abuse. According to studies, all these people who committed these grave crimes all had one thing in common: PORN.
What - is God coming in the year 2100 to judge us then? Not in 2000?Why would God have to tweak anyhow. The guy is all-powerful. So he created some single-celled organisms billions of years ago, and then said to himself "I'm going to set this thing called evolution going and see what happens. Yes, I'll tweak these tiny organisms a bit. Then maybe humans will evolve some day and I can make Mary give birth to Jesus."Yes, that all makes a lot of sense. A good use of God's time.
It's better to have a lousy father for practical reasons. You can blame every mistake you've made on your father. He won't pry into your business and search your room and take your stuff because he doesnt think I need it. He wouldnt care so much that he would get pissed and throw my backpack with my computer in it at a wall putting a hole in it because I didn't clean the sink after breakfast or I forgot my keys. I think it's actually an opinion because that kind of father is still lousy because he'll tell you that he hates you and I ruined his life.
Same sex marrage can couse a lot of contriverse, it puts peoples life at risk in extrem cases gay marrage has caused so much trouble pepole has resulted in murder and sucied
i remember the only country by whose fear alexander's army was afraidit was INDIAafter just sixty years of independence INDIA is looked as the country to become the sixth member of security council of UNand it is also the country with a great development rateAnd i know that none of us are unknown to the great contribution of INDIA in the discovery of god particalthen from where the matter comes from that INDIA is not having the pottential
Lets see Hitler committed suicide in a bunker in Germany in 1945 which makes him DEAD.President Bush is alive and well in the year 2006Unless one of them can time travel its impossible for them to be the same a********.  I understand about the different s**t part.I may never get to level 4 by answering all these types of questions but its starting to get less boring see ya
that depends.. I lost a friend a year ago to drugs.. very sad...Drug use in general is psychological thing... there are studies that suggest people who use drugs are self medicating for some other diagnosable mental illness....for example.. many alcoholics are found to have symptoms of anxiety and panic disorders... this is a good example of peer pressure.. nobody wants to hear about a grown man acting like a sissy?. society says.. "hell no.. lets go out and drink.."the problem with drug use is.. you are covering one problem with another.. therapists will have to spend many years dealing with the drug problem before they can even begin to address what caused the compuslion to use drugs...so yes. i believe in treatment.. i believe you should help yourself... however.. one can only get treated if they are willing to accept help.. for repeat offenders .. i offer no sympathy..
not really cause u didn't fill out an accident report and your work will argue u did it at home and u have not proof that u did it on the job that is why even a minor cut should be reported to your supervisor or u have no case did u tell anyone that your back was hurting before u left work and if u did they have to sign an affidavit that u did hurt yourself on the job and put their job in jeopardy and risk losing their job too so if u do hire a lawyer u better be ready to fight a long and powerful battle and nine times outta ten u lose so its best to goto the chiropractor keep your job and mark this up as a lesson the next time tell someone a couple hundred dollars is worth more losing your job and possibly getting black balled from gettin another cause when u fill out an app i don't care what anybody says your ex employer can black ball u and tell them what happened and u won't get the job
Dear Friend,I'm not sure I agree with the premise of your question.  Racial profiling consisted of a systematic suspicion of particular minorities as inherently criminal.  If insurance companies were to charge all, say, black customers more than white customers on the suspicion that black drivers get in more accidents, I'm quite sure they would be subject to suit.But, in any event, law enforcement personnel carry and use guns and handcuffs, send people to jails and prisons, have the capacity to ruin the lives of innocent people who happen to be of a particular minority.  Insurance companies... sell insurance, which you can get from hundreds of competitor companies.  Discrimination in law enforcement just matters a whole heck of a lot more than discrimination by insurers.Your Friend,Francesois
I think black people have their rights protected. The state gives them the same rights as others. And don't give me examples. It won't change my view. I am aware that probably their education rates are lower and their poverty rates are higher, but it doesn't matter. That's probably affected by the discrimination that happened in the past or it's just their fault for not being successfully integrated into society. As I said I don't want to see statistic about poverty, education levels, criminal levels, how many of them are living in ghettos or what % of them are in the higher positons of the state hierarchy. I want facts about how are they actually discriminated.PS. Sorry for grammar
Violence is perpetuated and caused by society.Advertising reminds us of all the things we do not have and makes us feel inferior for not having them.The news makes us distrust each other. Our distrust of each other causes us to treat each other not as people but as things to interact with.We have people screaming at salesmen- why? Because we don't see them as the same as us. What makes a telemarketer so evil but the high pressure of modern living forcing them to not let you off the phone.We kill because we feel upset with our own lives, we are frustrated because we are sent images of friends that we'll never have, products we can't afford, and movies full of lives we'll never live.It's not video games, it's televison programming and society that cause this. There are fewer suicides in small farming communities than in large cities, and less murders, because people are more close knit and friendly to each other.
I think it is bad to wear school uniform because it makes you look unatrel and you cannot express yourself enough so band school uniform OK
That doesn't make much sense. Why are we still evolving and the monkeys aren't?Why aren't fish jumping out of the water and growing legs?I mean, if it happened billions of years ago than how come its not happening today?Why can't we find psuedo-hybrid fish with legs forming?What caused evolution to stop happening for a mysterious time of thousands of years?
Some people say God is against porn. But we won't know that because the bible does not mench porn because it did not exist during biblical times. So how do we know it is a sin?
Means you don't have to worry about what you hve to wear!Less awkward when people say wear school uniform and you wear mufti...
I like tv because you can watch all the porn you want with your family
What?!? And all these years I've been paying. . .No, we are absolutely required to pay income taxes! We actually OVER-pay each year, and then in the Spring we get a partial refund. That's always nice, to help cover any credit card purchases we may have made at Christmas, or to do a home improvement project. But many Americans end up having to pay in even more, because not enough has been deducted from their wages throughout the previous year. OUCH!
You have all missed the point.Confidential sources within the Government that leak classified information  are not covered by the freedom of the press.When a court order is issued, there is more at stake than a news story.  Often the court order compromises one case to resolve another.When you have someone that leaks vital information that threatens the welfare of the American People (nuclear secrets, etc), you might give up a case against a squealer to get the name of the mole.Freedom of the press means you can publish what you want.  It doesn't mean that you are free of the consequences.Geraldo got thrown out of Iraq for airing the American battle plans for Bagdad before the battle.He shoulda been hung.
When considering any changes to the structures of any of their professional leagues, a lot of arguments revolve around how parity can best be maintained or enhanced.I don't see why anybody cares.The most exciting moments and periods in sports happen when there's a handful of titans ducking it out, not a mediocre field where anybody can win.Sure, Barcelona/Real Madrid/Atletico Madrid are miles ahead of most of their competition in La Liga. But tons of people who otherwise would never watch a match will tune in when they face each other.People don't tune in to watch games between two middle-of-the-pack teams nearly as much as they do for games between the top two teams in probably any sport.True parity, if achieved, would mean that every team is a middle-of-the-pack team.Why should I prefer that than having a handful of teams that are truly great and exciting to watch?
Based on an assumption that humans are artificial and not part of nature, then if we could create another being capable of being a sentient life form, it would not be equal to us no matter how more intelligent, until it has achieved the same things as us, including creating more sentient lifeforms. If it does achieve those things, then it would have to do so at same rate, otherwise if it was faster it would be greater than us, or if slower than still inferior to us. However this would only be the case of course if we as "artificial beings" of God our creator, would be capable of creating another sentient being in the same image and likeness of our creator and not just ourselves. Otherwise it would never be our equal.
Trapper was a pretender, a goofball who got out while the gettin' was good. While he was back in the States starting his private practice (Trapper John, MD), BJ was with Hawkeye until the end. As the war dragged on, and Hawk was starting to lose it, did Trapper call to see how they were? No, but BJ was delighting his comrades with home films of Peg and Erin, pranking Charles, and taking over surgery while Hawkeye was seeing chickens on buses.
I think the worst problem can be when debaters spend a significant portion of their time debating about trivial things...such as misspellings. We all do it on occasion...don't we? I could bicker about the member who posted the debate on being illiterate...and rant on about how ridiculous it is to make such a remark...after all, how could posters be illiterate, if they read and write? The person who created the debate obviously doesn't get that...even if it is just an attempt at being sarcastic...but what's the point?
If god loves everyone then y does he hate gays and the bible is just a book, have you ever wondered that the one cardinal who translated it changed some things to make "god" look good
The minimum length for an argument is 50 characters. The purpose of this restriction is to cut down on the amount of dumb jokes, so we can keep the quality of debate and discourse as high as possible.
well, you see people these days are to busy to see what is going on in the world.  I may not know everything, but from I think people are just to stupid to just watch what Bushy (please do not sue me because i just said "Bushy" instead of Bush,I just like the name like that)here is doing. You see, also people are sometimes to poor to buy their own TV set or even a newspaper(or they're just to lazy too) because of taxes,gas prices,and ALL OF THEIR LITTLE STUPID FRIEND!!!!!!!!And there is my opinion, you may not like what I just wrote, but DEAL WITH IT!
If you have read some of the other reviews you'll see that service is an issue.  Our group of 3 encountered the same experience at lunch on a weekday.  The staff were all young.  I did not see anyone who appeared to be older than 22 years of age.  Perhaps they need someone older with some customer experience??The food was great.  The bok choy was outstanding.  Just about all of the dishes show on the menu with a little chili pepper symbols.  However, we did not find them to be all that spicy. The 3 stars is for the service.  5 stars would be for the food.We'll return here but allow a little more time to pay the tab since they are slow at cashing out.  So, if you have a certain time available to you for lunch you may not want to dine here.
sabrejimmy,I have not tried to prove ANYTHING. All i asked was for YOU to prove that we are not evolving.Not once did i say that we are still evolving.I have not made any such assertions.So until you can show that we are not evolving with credible evidence, you are just avoiding something you cannot answer.So i say again, back up YOUR claim that we are not evolving.And the big bang is a red herring, we are talking about evolution, NOT Cosmology.It looks like you are trying to steer the debate away from what it is because you cannot back up your claims.
The real issue is - why is the government involved in this issue at all? We take a personal, religious institution and regulate it, then the government comes back and wants to redefine it.It should not be a political issue, because my personal, religious things should be separate from government regulation.Marriage and the government should not mix. That solves the "problem".
Gay marriage is wrong. God made man and a woman to populate the earth. How can human species survive if they are only attracted to their same sex? Obviously, not.
gays are overrated. it is another "look at me" stunt. i think gays are the product of overly protective parents, abuse, or liberal wakoness (it should be a disease).if you gays would stop calling attention to yourselves, nobody would really care what you do.
aah...u r saying like that only india has this things.....other countries donot have this.....does the america which seems as leading the world doesnt have bad qualities.....it eats less and waste more.....the amount of food they waste can be utillised for feeding whole indian population...it produces more pollution and blame us...what about it !!!!!!!
Statistics prove that less than 1% of women who are raped get pregnant because of the adrenalin rush. We have no right to take an unborn child's life. There are ways to avoid the situation of abortion. The woman can have the baby and give it up for adoption or raise it as their own because the woman is the still the child's biological mother. There are thousands of people on the waiting list for another baby to add to their family. DO NOT let anyone tell you otherwise because they obviously havn't been in the situation of adoption or abortion.
please it is president Clinton, and though people are going to say it is just politics it is the same issue. if it is wrong now it was wrong then.  if anything there has always been a double standard between Democrats and Republicans.  people are screaming about an illegal war can not remember president Clinton asking congress for any wars he got us in. but you have president Bush who did go to congress.
If the judge couldn't hear her clearly then I think he has every right to ask for the person in question to remove her veil.  If the woman who is a lawyer could not be understood in court then she is not doing her job properly due to the presence of her veil and the judge could not do his job properly either.  I can only respect for asking for the veil to be removed, I mean it isn't for very long and she was fighting for someone in court!  We're in Britain here where the covering your face is seen as suspicious, these women relly need to think about the message the veil puts across about them and their religion.
Why not?  People complain it is against God.  so those who feel that way should decline wedding invitations from gays.  MAN makes these rules and uses God as an excuse.  There are religions where a man can have many wives; do you  hear anyone complaining?  Anyway marriage does not have to be a religious ceremony.  People get married every day by a Justice of the Peace, a Mayor, even a ship's captain.  atheists get married.  what's the big deal?   so all the people who think this is a sin, would leave the "sinners" alone,  after all isn't it their God's job to judge them?  and to "punish".  They do believe their God gave them "free will" don't they?
I work in downtown LA and the homeless problem here is pretty bad. There was a guy who threw his shits in front of our building this morning. At the food court I go to, homeless guys sometimes walk around and beg for change. They're also begging and sleeping on the LA subways because our subways don't have turnstiles and rely on the honor system. They are a nuisance to everyone. Most of them look like they have mental illness. I think for any major city to develop faster, it needs to get rid of the homeless problem. I think homeless should be rounded up, put into camps, and treated for their mental health or addiction problems. That way major downtown area could be cleaner and safer and the homeless could get the treatment they need. The approach that most cities have of ignoring the problem won't work and it really hurts the local economy.
I understand the democratic party collects the most money from PACs. I understand as a union guy that our dues are paltry, and the teamsters and other unions supply a comparatively tiny amount of money to politicians as opposed to corporations. There is already so much undue influence by corporations that I think the ability to fund pro-union politicians would be a fine democratic check to the power of capital. When a politician wants to use legislation to curtail my right to assemble and air my grievances it reminds me of state socialist countries that do the same to their autonomous worker organizations.
In comparison to civil dress, school uniforms prove to be futile and wasteful once the child is out of school.
India does not have the potential to lead the world because the country is full of corruption, corruption in politicians ,numerous religion, fight between various religions, and a lot more............................
Whether you are in a venture purely for yourself or others, you still end up affecting the people around you.When asking someone why they decide to help with the common good, the response would be something along the lines of, "it feels good to help out."Ultimately, people don't help out people unless they get some sort of satisfaction out of it, be it whether they community service hours, material rewards, fame, or just having the satisfaction of knowing that you have importance. So when helping out others, you make others feel good as well as yourself.
there isnt an excuse in the world to kill a fetus, a baby, a child, anyone.if the woman was raped, it most certainly is Not the baby's fault. the woman with the baby whoever they are should speak For the baby, and know that the baby would want to live.
Because it would be thoroughly unfair to force people to pay for things they can't afford.Get real.  "Allow" connotes freedom, which is all a government should give you.  And that same "allow" is what permits anyone to make whatever they want out of themselves, purchase whatever they want.  You'd have a gripe if you could phrase the question "How can the US FORBID people from buying food or health insurance," but you can't.
I take the view that, school uniform is very comfortable. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Every teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.
This is a rather simple choice for me. I choose pro-choice because I have the option to choose pro life. If I choose pro-life I have no choice.
From a biological standpoint, men and women were "engineered" to be together. This idea was corrupted by the morals and society of our time.
Christianity conflicts with historical, archaeological, astronomical, biological, and many other forms of evidence. It denies rational & impartial common sense. Its teachings, written by an all powerful, all knowing, creator of the universe, are filled with contradictions. The arguments for Christianity just don't hold ground (bar one or two, and those are close). Atheism is not perfect, but it is the more logical position of the two.
It seems that what bothers you most is the inconsistency of laws.  We have laws that are supposedly in place (like the seatbelt law) to protect ourselves from harming ourselves -- yet we have not legislated all forms of self-harm.  What I find most annoying is the artificiality of saying we pass these laws to "save lives."  I believe the reality is that we pass these laws to save other taxpayers for picking up the cost of a person's health care if they've chosen self harming behavior.  (Examples:  seat belts, motorcycle helmets, recreational drug use.)  If we were just honest, and said these things are illegal because we as a society don't want to have to bear the costs associated with medically caring for those injured as a result of less "safe" behavior, I think most of us would find such laws much less distasteful.
in response to another person's answer, if cigarettes were made illegal, it would save countless peoples' health and lives. it would save hospitals thousands of patients with cigarette-induced cancer. i dont think that is a loss of money. it would only save lives and money.besides, cigarette industry deserves to crash. i would love to see that day. all those sleaseballs selling death deserve to be jobless. not teachers and medics and firefighters.those of you who support cigarette legality are losers.
Yes, in North Carolina, there is a three day waiting period to purchase a hand gun. This is after you have taken the time from work to take a state mandated fire arms safety course, go to your county's sheriff's office and fill out the necessary paperwork for a criminal background check and FBI search and fill out an application for hand gun purchase. In the mean time, you could have bought as many of what ever you want off a street corner in one day and be done with it. The criminals have it made in this country...why do they make honest people go through so much to get a hand gun? I know other states are even harder to deal with....New York being one of the toughest! They're trying to make honest people not want to even have guns.Why isn't there a national standard on the gun law? Should individual states be able to create their own laws concerning something straight out of the Constitution?
Not only this but anything 'intrinsic' to that person is more to do with an environment which is outside of their control than something they choose or even genetics."Give me a child until theyre 7 and i will give you the man"The world is one big chaotic system. Literally EVERY SINGLE choice you make, even subcobscious ones come together to create your destiny so the choices you do make as an adult are a product of how the world treats you as a child and the seemingly meaningless mundane choices we make decide through butterfly effect more than the ones that seem meaningful anyway.
Cats, definitely. They are independent. You don't have to take them everywhere you go and have to watch them and make sure they eat and use the facilities because they can't on their own.Cats are amazing animals and pets. They aren't always happy like dogs are, almost to the point where they are too stupid to know the difference."Cats make you work for their affection, they don't sell-out like dogs do" Jack Burns from Meet the Parents!With cats, there is no cleaning up the yard, having to walk a dog and cleaning up their sh$t, no loud-ass barks in the middle of the night, no slobbering all over the place, no puppies pissing all over the floor, etc.Cats are adorable creatures.Dogs are...well....:sigh; dogs!
This is way too much of a blanket assertion, just being a "dictator" is no reason to dispose of, muche less permantely eliminate a so called dictator. Who determines who is a dictator? Assuming the world agrees a nation's leader is a dictator, why assaniate he/she? There have been "benign" dictators just as their has been evil non-dictators.
Just because you think your opponent has been brainwashed one way or the other does not make your argument any stronger
I dont want to say i officially have a position, but i want someone on the other side to answer this because i honestly just dont know:if a 14 year old is raped (which, we have established, happens), and she then gets pregnant, but because she is 14, she will die if she has the baby, what is the pro life decision? is it then pro-life to have an abortion?i just dont know and i want an answer from someone on the other side
let me start by saying i feel marriage as an institution is ridiculous and needn't exist, however thats another debate entirely. To me who wishes to get married is wholly irrelevant. Hell i think animals should be allowed to join in holy matrimony as well, it would certainley be an entertaining ceremony. Far more so then any wedding i have ever attended.
white males are slowly becoming the minority.sorry, but, no; i don't think there will be laws protecting white men.i don't think there should be ANY law like that. if you can do the job and do it well i don't think it should matter if you are white, brown, black, yellow, or red, male or female.just do the danged job and get paid.
In my opinion, the Tories are all a bunch of selfish money hoarding bastards who don't give a shit about anyone except themselves. Gove was an absolute blight on education and now we have this woman whose previous title is minister of women and equality but who also voted against gay marriage. She's highly in favour of a number of things that will only serve to benefit the rich and wealthy of the country (like academies and raising tuition fees even further) and I doubt that anything will change from Gove's reign of terror - We may even see it get worse.
