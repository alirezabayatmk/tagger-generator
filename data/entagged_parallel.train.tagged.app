I wouldnt turn her in becuase she is my wife. She made a mistake that we can get over it. If she trusted me by telling me what [app9] then I couldn't do that to her.
Although being fatherless is probably one of the biggest hardships, undesired by all. I would rather be fatherless, than to have to deal with someone who on a [app9] basis would frustrate me. At least when you have no knowledge of a father, you only ponder on it from time to time. On the other hand, a lousy father would be with you in your thoughts forever.
although i [app0] for evolution... creation is easier to accept due to the fact that someone somewhere had to change aspects of the universe in order for us to exist.
PE should be compulsory because it keeps us constantly fit and healthy. If you really dislike sports, then you can quit it when you're an adult. But when you're a kid, the best thing for you to do is study, play and exercise. If you [app15] be lazy and lie on the couch all day then you are most likely to get sick and unfit. Besides, PE helps kids be better at teamwork.
To me, a founder would be a leader, well respected by the organisation/group he is managing. Both Raffles and Farquhar were good leaders. However, when William Farquhar was sent off to Britain, more people went to [app12] off than the combined number of people that sent Raffles off during the three times Raffles left Singapore. This shows that the people of Singapore respected Farquhar more than Raffles, and to them, Farquhar was a more [app20] leader.
Actually, we are evolving. Look this one up; every generation our small toe is becoming [app5] smaller. Eventually, we'll end up losing it.I know it's a small, simple, seemingly useless appendage and who really cares about it, but it is evolution at work.
I think common good is better [app2] its [app3] help other people. I [app5] when i help people because it makes me feel happy that im doing something [app11] life.
Uniforms allow an equal and fair social status only based on personality and not looks. I do half to admit wearing what you want is fun and creative but its only fun if everyone can do it and for some children thats not the [app14] they cant afford to live up to their peers standards so uniforms [app19] social life [app20] and it would give a more mature look to the school.
THE SCHOOL UNIFORM IS A VERY GOOOOOOOOOD IDEA , WHY ??becouse the school uniform makes [app5] concentrated on their education than on their clothes and I believe [app9] uniform instills discipline among [app11] it makes [app12] with diferent material statuses more equal :)
To have a father is better than to not have one at all. I know that a lousy father is very bad to have and he probaly wont do all the [app10] a good father would do, but at least yo have that assurance that you [app15] that is a father in your life. I beileve that people can change. You can never feel the same way about somebody for your whole life. There will come a time in his life that he will realize that he needs to be there for you. You have no father, then you have no chance of that at all.
I say no because spanking doesn't really solve the problem, [app3] get over a [app5] fast, and do whatever [app6] again. So its [app8] be a bit strict, than to abuse a kid.
It all depends on the severity of the kill. Ofcourse I would be empathetic towards [app5] and want him free, but if I knew it was a malicious deed instead of self defense, or to defend his family or belongings I would probably leave and want nothong to do with it.
The Bible is not the origin of marriage. Marriage is found in almost every society, including those that were never touched by Christianity (or Judaism) and societies that preceded Christianity (and Judaism). The Bible can only be [app12] to be the origin of Christian marriage, and even that is difficult to prove.
Sallu, thanks for answering my question. Politics is very useful to people. The nation we live in exists because it is built around laws and values the people support. Without police I would be afraid to go outside without a gun. Think more theoretical. Why don't terrorists blow up every city here? I mean are frisked everytime you leave your house? No. Politics is the governing body that has developed public safety. It is supposed to be built by the people it governs. Arguments happen so people can learn to understand one another and learn. It is okay to debate. You don't have to always be right but take time to learn. Its not politics that destroys people, its the media projecting it. Whether you are democrat or republican, you must admit the media slanders whomever is in office. Clinton almost got impeached and the media was all over it. Cheeny with the gun accident, oh they are having a hayday. Just be patient, listen close, and VOTE!!!
no, if your connected to city sewers you have to pay. check with your city councilman. they probably negotiated a billing delay when they were first installed. even if it was a city oversight. its a service you have to pay for. they charged me xtra sewer when i filled my pool and thats 6000 gal worth, even [app19] didn't [app20] the drain. if they can charge you they will. [app20] neighbors are connected, they don't give you a choice.
Contrary to what most people think, most states do not have laws addressing minimum ages to babysit or minimum ages that children can be left alone. Unless someone can cite a specific Illinois law, chances are the answers you get here are of little value. While 15 or 16 might sound like logical numbers, that doesn't [app18] answers are correct on the law.I don't know Illinois law nor am I going to make up some number for you.
OK, why not create a [app1] create a national drivers license. We need the law because a standard drivers license [app7] the country more [app8] against terrorists. Many of the 9-11 terrorists had drivers licenses they would not have been able to obtain under the stringent requirements you're putting in your bill. The bill requires proof of citizenship, at least a minimal skill with the English language, and proof of address. The licenses will be granted and regulated by the Department of Homeland Security. The [app20] will be funded by the fees paid by the drivers, so it will not need tax revenues. It will actually remove a burden from the states.
The appeal must be won. The court holds the [app3] addullted, void, overturned as if [app5] longer exists. Expungement of the records is another matter and that requires more legal work. Even if that were to be granted, there is always a paper trail and just, for example, the fact that someone was arrested in the first place will always be part of that trail. It is practically impossible to get rid of all of the record, even with a court order.
If my neighbor smokes pot, it doesn't pick my pocket, it doesn't break my leg, it doesn't infringe on any of my rights. How then, is it any of my business? My nieghbor's body belongs to my neighbor -- he has the right to take risks with that body. It isn't an appropriate function of government to make us "be good"; if it were, we'd soon have laws compelling us to exercise and eat our spinach. Our current drug [app20] doing more harm than the drugs themselves.
your crime does not fit under discrimination, as you committed that crime. That was a choice, unlike race, gender, etc...I don't think that everyone will turn you down, I typically look at the crime when hiring, and believe me, there are a [app14] people out there with records than you would guess. If someone was a thief, or violent, I will not hire them. Companies can refuse to hire for ANY reason. It may just be that here in MIchigan the economy is so bad, and unemployment is so rampant, that their just aren't enough job openings. But, I would be honest about yourself, if they are asking.
This is an interesting question in light of the laws that punish some people more severely than others because of their opinion, even when [app8] exactly the same act. I am referring to "Hate Crime" laws that enhance a criminal offense because of the person's opinion/rationale for [app15] the crime. So, if [app17] kills another person because he hates that person’s ethnicity or religious views then he will receive a harsher punishment than another guy who kills without hate, simply because he enjoys killing. The point is, you may be entitled to your own opinion, but you will be punished for your thoughts and NOT just the act.
I think you have a case . . . did you happen to take [app4] of all of these "repairs"? Sometimes just the threat of small-claims court will get them to write a cheque. You may have to pay a lawyer to write up the court documents, unless the [app16] is willing to help you out. You did agree to the repairs, but you could argue that you expected them to be close to the original quality. The fact that they [app20] repair the stand, indicates they insured the UNIT part also. Good luck.
With the other issues of depending on the government aside, you need one to protect yourself. Regardless of whether the police are [app7] protect you, if you have a person break into your house in the middle of the night, you may not have time to call the police. Even if you do and they are only five minutes away, you can [app20] a hundred times over in [app20] minutes. You have a right and a duty to defend yourself and your family.
i think prostitution is overrated, if people wanna have sex and get paid way not. a women can have sex with many men and get nothing is considered a whore, but if the men throw her a few dollars, she is a prostitute, why? why give it up for free. my take is if a guy friend of mine want's to have sex with me and my light bill is due, and i don't have it, hey, why not, get [app20] feel good while doing it
Every time I hear the Wilhelm scream (and it has been used in over 200 films) I am completely removed from the scene and sometimes even laugh at what might be a serious scene. Often it is used so unsubtly that it just reflects lack of effort from the director and it seems as if they are just trying to fit the scream into the film somewhere with no [app20] to what effect this has on the film. I understand that it is an "in-joke" but I believe that it is too widely [app20] to be used any more without the [app20] acknowledging it.
For instance, prostitution stings should be illegal. And drug deal stings. Anything that does not have a victim, and there is no physical harm/ bad intentions. If a police officer witnesses a drug deal, or a prostitution deal, that's one thing. (Although, I believe these both should be decriminalized, but thats neither here nor there). Setting people up for these crimes, to me seems as if the police are "shopping" for criminals to take in. Baiting and reeling them in. Often times, these people may have gone about their days without [app20] a crime.
With all the hoopla over the fifth anniversary of Michael Jackson's death (which I don't think was truly accidental but that's for another CMV), I'm reminded of how his death did something powerful. Dying more or less voided out most if not all of the bad he did in the public conscience.I know MJ isn't an isolated case and it seems to be the rule for people who die young from JFK to Tupac or from John Lennon to Andrew Brietbart. However, outside of the "never speak ill of the dead" adage I can't see any reason why humanity keeps deifying the prematurely dead. To see one's bad [app20] scrubbed away on Earth with no one to speak of them again just feels wrong and downplays their earthly acts.I think speaking ill of the dead who did bad things should totally be acceptable and death should not be a cleanse to one's legacy. Am I alone here?
One of my favourite [app1] of all time! I believe John Hammond had a great vision, but was poorly advised by his HR department, thus severely underpaying his most vital employees. Other than that: - The Park would be a major boost to the economy of the Dominican Republic, as well as any other nation where it opens shop. - it would motivate kids across the globe to venture into science disciplines.-it would further our understanding of our planet.The possibilities are endless. As long as we *spare no expense*So, can you CMV?
I see that there's actually no arguments, so I'm just going to clarify a few things for the 'Yes' argument.Even though Principals do obtain the right to search (for drug tests, even making the student take off his/her socks if the dog sniffs something on that student), they only retain that right in the [app18] of reported drugs or crime, or in the case that sniffer [app20] checks are enacted and the dog smells something.There are restrictions - a principal can't just demand to search a student's possessions on whim - outlined in the Criminal Code. YCJA and Canadian Charter of Rights (as well as parallel US laws).Thus, the right keeps the entire student body safe and away from harmful substances.
I've had this [app1] with [app1] various times. I think that the name 'Sublime' does not accurately describe the band to which it refers.First, there are multiple definitions for the word. "elevated or lofty in thought, language, etc." certainly does not describe the band, nor does "impressing the mind with a sense of grandeur or power; inspiring awe, veneration, etc." But what about "supreme or outstanding"?Of course, there is a certain amount of opinion involved in this. But the general consensus, I think, would be that the name does not describe the band.I don't have anything against the band, or their choice of name. In fact, I like a few of their songs. But it is certainly ironic that 'sublime is not sublime'.
Our [app0] supply cannot continue indefinably, and if allowed to continue the likely result would be hyperinflation and another depression.When you give the government the right to print money that isn't backed by anything, you give them the opportunity to steal quietly from the public without anyone noticing.Finally, every nation in history who has switched to fiat currency has eventually gone bankrupt, because the government couldn't resist the urge to hyper inflate the [app20] supply, and make all of the money useless. Those who do not know history, are doomed to repeat it.
I am an Englishman who predominantly enjoys English music. Yet I would argue that America has birthed greater music.The whole bedrock of modern popular music is founded upon Blues and Jazz which as we all know originated in the US.Without Blues and Jazz there would be no Beatles, Rolling Stones or any other major British band pre 1977.Don't forget there's also Hip-hop and Punk. Both original American art-forms which have had a major influence [app20] UK music scene since the late seventies and early eighties.In terms of popular music the US leads where the UK follows and adapts.
I believe that it was a "learning experience" for our country. Without prohibition, who knows what would be happening now. I think [app7] having the prohibition law THEN, we we're able to see that it didn't work and we can decide better on circumstances like that in the future. While it wasn't a strictly "good thing", I do not believe it was a bad thing for our country to undergo.
I guess its good food if you're one of those people who like big burgers, but not me. I find it over rated. My girlfriend recommended it. The fries are yummy. Very fresh. But I wouldn't go there for the fries. They have bags of peanuts that you can put into little paper bowls and munch on while you wait so thats kinda cute. The decor is like a 50's diner. So if you like big juicy [app20] than yeah, go here. Me personally, its a no.
Lucky for us the wait was only 20 minutes. Everyone and their mom recommends this place. They gave our oysters to the wrong people, so we didnt get ours till after our main dish came out. Then we [app12] eat them and they weren't even shucked correctly, they muscle was still stuck to the shell. I also [app19] Palace Pan Roast which [app20] good, but kind of too rich for my taste. I would go back, but only if there wasn't a line.
I ordered chicken chow mein and my coworker ordered [app3] chow fun. First of all our delivery took an hour! Second, my coworker watched the delivery driver drop our Thai tea, thus cracking the lids & spilling tea everywhere. Next, he didn't have change! How are you a delivery driver with no change? Now [app18] the food.... My coworker said hers was "okay", not anything special. My chicken chow mein was disgusting! The noodles were extremely over cooked, leaving them gooey, soggy, [app20] messes of dough. The chicken, I'm not even certain if it was chicken, had so much fat, gristle and muscle it was not edible! And the grease..... So much grease! If you are craving good, quality Chinese food, this is [app20] the place!
I really don't know because i think it depends on who she murdered and how it happened. If it [app6] defense then no I wouldn't tell the police, but if she just went crazy and murdered someone then yes i would tell the police.
I would [app0] he murdered someone. Don't get me worng I would try to persuade him first [app6] himself in but if that didn't happen I would have to take reponsiblity for him. Plus I wouldn't want to feel the guilt of always [app15] I didn't turn that murder in. If he truly loved me I wouldn't have killed someone.
No I would [app1] i would have taken a vow say to stick by them in sickness and health. They might be sick in the head but she would be my wife. If anything id be trying to find a way to keep her from getting caught.
Raffles was the boss of farquhar and thus should be the [app3] Singapore sine he was the [app6] and had more rights than farquhar. In addition, farquhar did not carry out his duties responsibilily [app11] slaves, cockfighting and murders everywhere in Singapore. Singapore was so poorly developed that Raffles was unhappy.
I was a IE user from the beginning, but recently I started using Firefox. Apart from the obvious differences like availability of tabs in Firefox which was not avaible in IE I don't find any other significant [app12] in using firefox. Also now IE7 has got the tabs feature included, along with add-ons to provide different functionalities.So I think IE is better than firefox.
i think school uniform is really good idea!Yes i agree that a lot of [app4] don't like it, but however it have a lot of benefits. As [app9] people said children at first don't have to think about what to wear!because it is very big problem for teenagers.
I think that it is [app1] have a [app3] is lousy because I consider my father on a low level of lousy, and I think that I'm doing just fine.I just think thats it better to know that you have a father. I think that not knowing him, or what he looks like would ( to me ) be a insecure topic in my life. So, in my opinion. Just to [app20] exist would be better to me.
Neither. Agnostic is the true answer. People can [app2] is a God or they can believe there isn't- but they can never know. I personally believe there isn't a God but I can never prove this definitely.
[app0] can be sometimes good for the [app2] understand but not to the point [app5] can hurt and should not be used repeatedly
I believe some [app1] spank their kids [app2] when nessasary because sometimes thats the only way some kids will learn the correct way and listen.
Hypocricy runs rampant in both parties. You know what would be a better way to select our canidate by having actual facts as to how the [app8] on any and all issues when they were in government. This way you know if this person is voting the way you want them to on the issues that are important to you. What was their absent record. After all aren't we all their bosses to some extent we put them in office. You know what irks me the most it's the wonderful raises they give themselves. If there is something that should be put in the ballot it's rather or not they should have a pay raise. After all where else can you go to work and decide gee I am giving myself a payraise.However it's all a bunch of propaganda with mudslinging.
Personally I detest it. However, I find it a necessary evil since my [app4] I own our own electrical company that offers [app7] hour service. We get a lot of calls on our cell phones at night since we have our land line forwarded to our cells when we are not at the office. However, we always put our phones on silent/vibrate when we are in a public place. That way we don't disturb anyone around us.
It would be little differnt from owning a block of land most or all islands are [app5] responsibility of a near country or are called a protectorate of a country so even though you owned that "island block" you could not do as you wish.though there is a chance you could have local laws such as a town has but remember who is going to police them.
There is an old adage: "Sunlight is the best disinfectant".If you openly confront this woman, you are facing an all-out war. She will despise you for having exposed her misdeeds. If you anonymously send the General Manager proof of her actions, he may be inclined not to believe the accusations.You could have a meeting with the General Manager, and ask for anonymity. However, you must have all your facts completely established. Getting people to write their opinion will not be accepted as fact.You need absolute proof, and to show her INTENT to cheat and lie. She [app20] claim these were innocent mistakes or things done without her knowledge.Remember, you will need verifiable dates, names, events, [app20] importantly, a CONSISTENT story [app20] person who was a witness to any of these events.You do not want to come across as a whining malcontent. If you show indisputable proof, the General Manager will have to act.
I come from a family where my family was involved and to an extent still is involved with the troubles in Northern Ireland. While I [app8] been explicitly told that the IRA and Sinn Fein are evil people, I have been given a very negative view of them.It seems to me that the IRA were blowing up the Unionists because they wanted the Republic of Ireland to have territorial expansion into Northern Ireland and them wanting to be part of Northern Ireland was blantantly false. The Republic of Ireland has more or less existed by since WW1, so moving there was not out of the question for the IRA and sympathisers.I also think that IRA supporters should be tried as criminals who are acting against the UK government and are thus guilty of treason.
Incumbents have the advantage of being able to grant political favors immediately, better financing, gerrymandering, and name recognition. Challengers need a boost to make it fair. This would cause higher turnover, which would be good because:* It would reduce the corrupting influence of non quid pro quo contributions by making it more uncertain how long the purchased influence would last* High turnover of representatives would disrupt the habits that form which serve their interests over the people's, such as proposing the most contentious bills to wring money out of lobbyists* When a majority of representatives are freshmen, they will be more idealistic and less jaded, and this will help them serve the public goodI'm not [app20] the best way [app20] it is, but maybe just decrease incumbent's vote tally by 15% or so. My view is that something like this *should* be done, not that it's likely under present circumstances.
I understand that religion can be [app2] it teaches good morals, encourages people to [app5] ect. I also understand that many [app7] have started because of religion or have revolved around religion, for example WWII, Muslim Conquests, the Ottoman wars in Europe, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Another reason I think this is because of how other religions try to demonize one another. "Your religion is wrong and bad while mine is right and good! Let's fight about it!" There are also people and animals that are sacrificed for religion, people ignore science and rely on "faith", religious places (whether it be a church or temple whatever) are always asking for money, Censorship of speech, art, books, music, films, poetry, songs, etc.Not to mention people are [app20] into office often because of their religion.Suicide bombersSuppression of logical thoughtYou get the point. So reddit, CMV
All of these methods of killing result in long and painful deaths. Why is one acceptable but the other not?A bullet wound to the abdomen can cause intestinal agony for months, which seems on par with mustard gas. If infection sets in, possibly worse.Having your limbs blown off while you are conscious is probably worse [app18] gassed. Being burned by the flames from an explosion is probably on par with mustard gas burns.Assume that mustard gas is only used on the battlefield and doesn't spread [app20] areas such as civilian areas.
Listed for easier rebuttal and addressing:1. Putting a big amount of value on sex by seeing it as [app6] only do with [app7] can create tension later on in a relationship due to sexual incompatibility. 2. It is an integral part of a relationship, so by lessening [app16] on sex can allow people to explore this part of a relationship. 3. By treating it as just another activity to enjoy, it allows relationships to be built on other things such as trust, communication, emotional intimacy, etc. I personally believe that putting sex on a pedestal is potentially harmful to society and people in relationships. Thus, we should reduce the [app20] sex in society. CMV!
I was born just early enough to completely miss the Pokemon craze. Being on Reddit, I see how it's become a cultural touchstone for the generation born after mine, but I've never had any contact with the cards or games whatsoever. I've seen some bits of the TV shows, and they look dumb. Really dumb. The games, from what I can tell, combine the thrill of turn-based combat with the fun of grinding. CMV that Pokemon games are aimed at kids and there's no point to trying them for the [app20] as an adult.
Over the past couple of weeks I have attended or seen [app3] for family member graduation ceremonies for kindergarten, 6th grade, [app7] grade, and my daughter's high school graduation. I'm not talking about a simple gathering, I mean full out cap and gown, commencement speaches, hours long, etc full on graduation ceremonies.I feel that celebrating all these minor milestones in the [app20] way as the final goal completely diminishes that walk across the stage for the student when they earn their diploma or degree. Change my view
Take a situation where an individual is drunk at a party. Another notices him or her and requests to have a sexual encounter. If the first individual consents, then the individual has waived his or her right to accuse rape. This situation assumes the second party did not tamper with the firsts drink or, in any way, use the situation to his or her advantage maliciously (e.g. getting him or her drunk for the purpose of sexual intercourse) This was spurred by a [app20] between me and my girlfriend the other night. I want to know the arguments for her side, my own being the one presented.
Rowing is def. more intensive. The legs are typically the strongest limbs in the human body. Rowing for distance or time can be extremely taxing on the upper body and core. This argument of course assumes a person has cross-trained for each form of [app14] equally. Not everyone is a natural runner of course but may have insane upper body strength, and vise versa. So [app20] person to person. However, for the theoretical all-rounder, I'd have to say rowing.
Perhaps not all teens; there is a good case for new drivers. Perhaps in the first six months after passing the test, as well as provisional licensees (I think there are restrictions on this anyway) should have restrictions on the number of passengers.Personally, I would also sugest a restriction on how far a newly licesnsed driver can travel on thier own, [app20] them as the sole driver. Obviously this would be very hard to police, [app20] prevent thousands of dangerous accidents every year from new drivers on thier first motorway jaunt.
In this case I do not believe that the Phelps Clan is protected under the first amendment. I think they crossed [app7] by singling out one persons funeral. At that point it's almost an emotional hate crime against the Snyder family. Now, had they been somewhere else and been stating their beliefs against all military members or gay [app19] they would have been fine. But to single out out [app20] in particular and hold signs up saying "Semper Fi fag" and " Thank God for dead soldiers" is a direct emotional attack and should not be protected under the first amendment.
I was starving and wanted something quick and cheap. Based on reviews, I was dubious about coming here but a chicken taco sounded really good. I decided to live wild and try it out. A happy surprise was that it's taco Tuesday so I was able to get two soft tacos for $.99 each! I expected them to be measly but there was enough [app20] in it that one would've been plenty. Better yet - they tasted good enough that I [app20] both. (Or maybe that's worse because I'm quite full now). The iced tea was fresh, restaurant was clean and cheerfully decorated. They had a bar with four salsas, traditional veggies etc. I could've taken pix to show how much [app20] was in the tacos but instead, I [app20] them.
Relaxing [app0] be, [app1] terrace and good variety [app3] takes cash... Last time I was there the ATM didn't work either, although I don't really like using my card with unknown ATM machines. They should at least have debit...or Apple Pay. Other then that. Order at the counter and food at your table. Would go back for coffee break.
The granddaddy of big [app1] food. Tasty? yes. Inventive? not really. Oil and butter as substitutes for inventive, creative food? Most likely.Its hard to argue that you can exit the Cheesecake Factory without a full belly and a satisfying meal. Unfortunately, that comes at the cost of some of the most high calorie entrees imaginable.The place does a decent job of managing the huge demand put on it by the throngs of mall-goers hungry for some Wisconsin-sized plates. And to be fair, they do have a full "skinnylicious" [app20] to encourage, [app20] least offer, more healthy [app20] options. But at the end of the day, their [app20] seems to rely a bit to heavily on butter and oil as the primary constituents of flavor.
The [app0] I came here, I ordered a latte and it was on point. I was happy to support a local business and the girls working were friendly.The second time I came in I grabbed a hot tea and a yogurt parfait. I watched the lady scratching her butt through her yoga pants as she walked to the back to make it. Thankfully she washed her hands before she got started but I was already over it at this point. I didn't plan on eating anything but politely waited...and waited...and waited. They certainly put a lot of time and effort into a parfait. It was a pretty fancy yogurt option after [app20] wait... Except for the 18inch red curly hair wrapped in the top.Health code standards have gone out the window in the valley.
Mozilla Firefox can be used for everything! There are also plugins so that you [app4] the internet explorer [app6] in the firefox shell. It has many more plugins and the themes are a [app11] feature. all of the innovations in E 7.0 were in firefox years ago.
If my husband [app1] murder I wouldn't [app2] in because I [app4] must have had a good reason to do it. Everybody makes mistakes in this world and this would be a wrong decision he took. I love him and I feel that [app15] we should be by your partner throught the thick and thin no matter what. I wouldn't want [app20] to be in jail.
No I would not turn in [app2] because when you get married you promise to be there for eachother through good or through worse and I would anything to help her but, don't get [app11] though if [app13] were to get caught I will not go down with her because most likley I would have a family to take care of and would not leave them for anything.
It really sucks not having a man to look up to while your growing up. I believe that being fatherless is better [app7] a lousy father. The reason I believe this is the best is because you dont want to be looking up to a guy that does nothing in life and its just setting bad examples. Who knows you might grow up following his steps. So being fatherless is better because from day one you start depending on your own with no need of a father being there. And theres always going to be other people by your side helping you get through life.
I personally feel that it is [app2] be fatherless, rather than having a lousy father. I personally know what it is like . My father was very lousy. The last time I saw him was when I was thirteen, and i havn't heard from him since. It doesn't bother me because I don't know him, and because he's not around I am never set up for any disapointment. So I think that to be fatherless is much better.
Id rather be fatherless than to have a lousy father. Having a lousy [app4] tires to tell me what to but doesn't do anything with his life would just make me mad. Id rather be raised by my mother who is caring, loving, and actually does something with her life and works [app17] to make money to put food on the table.
In my opinion I think that it should be obligatory to have PE classes in schools because it offers children a bit of exercise. If in every school of the world PE classes would be obligatory there would [app12] less fat children. Of course also some health classes should be [app17] so that children know how to have a basic diet and so they won't be obese anymore.
When Farquhar left Singapore, more people were [app2] off than Raffles. This shows that the people [app6] Farquhar as their founder, not Raffles
The ability to do both would be awesome, but since I have to choose I'd rather help others in any way I can. Even a [app8] can impact someone's life, like being a friend or helping them with getting their needs to survive life.
I think [app0] uniform is a good idea. First it's make students look [app4] and tidy. Second we can know [app7] is study in which school or who is in a same school with us and finally it's convenient because we don't have to spend to much of time to choose clothes to school
I think is [app1] have a lousy Father than to be Fatherless, maybe having one is not that bad, other than living with the idea you didn't had [app9] with the doubt of how could it [app12] have one.
I would have to pick having a lousy father than not having a [app4] all because, there will be a point where you may need his help. (It may not help but at least you tried.) I know that I have a lousy father, and there are times that he gets me mad, but then again there are times where he does the dumbest things, and makes me laugh. I know that I don't have the father I want, but I still love him no matter how lousy he is.
I feel like it's better to have a lousy father than to not have one at all. If someone is bad at something, it [app8] there's always a possibility that one day they may be good at it. To be fatherless, there's not even a chance of having a good father. So to have a lousy father would be better.
Bottled water is somewhat less likely to be found in developing countries, where public water is least safe to drink. Many government programs regularly disperse bottled water for [app9] reasons. Distributing small bottles of water is [app12] than distributing large bulk storages of water. Also contamination from large water storage containers is much more likely than from single 12-20 ounce bottles of water.
Sometimes that's what a kid needs to behave [app2] Nos, stops, don't do that, just don't work sometimes.
Parents shouldn't use [app1] as an [app2] discipline it [app3] the child get [app5] than to see what [app6] wrong.
No because [app0] your child could mentally scar them for life. also it [app4] them think [app5] their kids is alright.
I would [app0] in whether it was self-defense or an [app3] rage. If it was self-defense they would [app6] get away with it but if it were an act of rage I would not want to [app13] rest of my life with that person. My conscience would eat at me and I could not live [app19] there's a family that is mourning because of my spouse's actions.
I would [app0] if they [app2] they [app3] murder. Weather it was by accident or on purpose. If it was an accident than the police will figure that out. For example, what if my spouse murdered your spouse. Wouldn't you want to know who killed him/her? I would, I wouldn't allow my self to rest until I knew. Sometimes in life their is more to worry about than yourself.
I put my argument on the side saying "yes" but in reality it really depends in my opinion. If [app6] killed someone in self-defense, I'd rather them kill the person than [app10] die, but if [app12] killed someone for no reason I probably would [app15] love may be strong but it can [app19] blind. I would not want to be married to a murderer because what if one day he decided to kill me?
while yes phys. ed. [app1] should still be in high schools they shouldnt be mandatory(especially not all 4 years of HS). maybe just having PE be an optional class and having one year be a mandatory thing instead of a continuous PE class. in lower grades, yes it should be mandatory because little kids are more likely to gain and lose weight in weird patterns. That Is All.
The official reason is that they make an 'orderly market'. They must buy and sell to keep the market from sudden and dramatic shifts. So they are forced to buy and sell under certain conditions. It is also true that the make full use of opportunities to buy and sell when they [app17] money. It's an unpleasant trade-off. I don't agree with them [app20] this policy but that's what is happening.
The CIA leak was far worse. When Valerie Plame's identity as a CIA agent was revealed, her life, [app6] the security of our country, was put in jeopardy. Clinton's infidelity only directly affected Hillary and Chelsea, and was no skin off the noses of everyone else. One reason why the media devoted less attention to Plamegate is because corporations who own the media are major Republican donors.
I don't want [app1] this into a bash-Bush answer (I try not to get mixed up in that) But one thing I have noticed is his inability to be an effective public speaker. You would think he has the best speech writers money could buy, right? Problem is..I don't think he uses them...I almost think [app18] wings the whole damn thing, but who knows.I don't see a problem with speech writers to be honest, if your a president of a company, or of a nation, what you say will effect many people. Hiring someone who is skilled in speeches and public policy is not only rational, but almost the only choice to properly convey the message you want everyone to hear.If you really want to hear how a person speaks, debates are a good [app20] start, since even though they have official "answers" to expected questions, they do have to be on their toes a bit more than when they give an address.
Well, since she signed for it, legally she can be held responsible for it. There is no way to get her name off the loan. The only way that she can try to get it off, is by disputing the signature on the promissory note, otherwise she's stuck. And no, he won't get off scott free either. They can take his tax return to pay on it. She needs to chalk it up to a lesson learned.To the dude below me: Student loans can not be discharged thru bankruptcy anymore. They will go after him first, because he is the primary borrower. If they can't collect from him, then they will go after her for the money. Like I said in my source, I [app20] a student loan company.I would urge her to call the loan company [app20] out the staus of the loan. I can tell you this, none of these things will happen until it goes into default.
You admitted fault here and I bet that you admitted fault there too.Read what you wrote and you will realize that you have no argument in court.He did not write the ticket for not stopping for the stop sign.He wrote the ticket for "failing to yield to oncoming traffic at a stop sign."Big difference, if you were struck by cross traffic it becomes obvious that you did not yield to their right of way!Your best bet would [app20] plead "no contest" [app20] the courts verdict without admitting guilt, it keeps you from looking foolish by trying to argue an open and closed case, and save face at the same time.
I'm been stuck with this debate with myself for months now, and I can't think what is the right moral path.. I've always thought that killing an animal for the right purpose, food and not fun, is morally right because there animals don't understand death, like a human does. They will have the same wonderful life, in the wild, even if I kill it or not.. As for [app20] animals, in order for food, I also think this is ok as long as the animals are treated right, and fair. That's why i'm a vegan right now, because I hate how the main [app20] sources we have come from horrible people who treat animals with un needed cruelty, or atleast it seems like they do.Edit: What i'm also asking is, is it wrong to actually eat [app20] from these factories? People make it seem like it's horrible, but I just don't know.Any pro and con arguments would help me out a lot, thanks!
Reason being: -My expected degree is in the scientific field, and a bachelors is a drop in the bucket in that area as prestige comes when a PhD is reached normally. -It is a normal [app11] in life for people who are serious about a future and there is no need to celebrate something that is expected and not surprising. -I have little emotional connection to the college I am finishing.-The college is not prestigious/well known for the area I am studying, therefore the coursework was not as vigorous as could be and thereby attending a ceremony that signifies to me little dedication towards studying and finishing my course work is frankly embarrassing.CMV.
I believe that no one should be allowed to be a permanent member and that the 5 countries with the largest influence on the world (defined thru a mix of economics, political, military power, and human rights records). Countries who fall far enough in any of those will lose their seat. As for the rest of the seats they would be [app20] as they currently are....as for veto power I believe that it is overpowered, for proof of this look towards North Korea...I believe that a 2/3 majority should be enough to get action on an issueI understand that this is 2 part, but they go together so I thought it should be ok to put them in 1 CMVEdit: View changed
This isn't referring to depression because of a terminal illness, but specifically about clinical depression prompting suicidal urges for years. Decades even.I don't view suicide as a choice - it's a fight or flight response. Some people cope others don't. Also my philosophy on [app14] of life undoubtedly skews my stance. I don't believe that anyone has an objective, inherent value and that disallowing someone to end their life [app20] their suffering for the comfort of society being uncomfortable with death. However, temporary bouts of suicidal behavior should be treated but at a certain point it becomes so chronic that pain overshadows pleasure. When someone has suffered for years with suicide but have held off because of guilt from family they are literally tortured into [app20] life rather than be allowed to bow out peacefully.
I watched Drive in theaters when it came out several years ago. Almost every single one of my friends absolutely LOVES the movie. The reasons they give are usually as follows: The artistic cinematography, great soundtrack, great acting etc. Now I don't hate the movie, but most [app15] friends said it was one of the best films that came out that year. I thought Gosling's character [app20] bland (yes I know he's supposed to be some sort of sociopath) but I feel like he was nothing more than a pretty face [app20] violent tendencies. The other actors were good, Cranston specifically, but nothing award winning. The soundtrack was really good but did little to elevate the movie to 'top 10 movie of the year' status.All in all I thought it was a boring film (save for the exciting 5 minute opening sequence) that kind of just went nowhere.Viewers who loved it, can you CMV?
This happens all the time online and in real life. Someone says something and another person says "that's racist," which is their trump card that they feel immediately discredits the other person's entire argument.Let's please ignore inflammatory racist statements. We all know they are bad.This "that's racist" trump card is played virtually any time race is a component of the discussion. A recent example is the Mark Cuban situation (let's please not debate that ITT). If you're unaware, Mark Cuban speaking of the Donald Sterling NBA fiasco said that if a black male in a hoodie is walking down the street he would switch to the other side, and if that ~~said~~ side had a white male with neck tattoos he would switch back.Cue outrage. People [app20] with "that's racist." I don't believe that "that's racist" inherently discredits an argument or observation. CMV.
They aren't really on the same level.Sure, Bleach is an enjoyable anime/manga but when you look at anime's the quality is vastly different.FMA's storyline was set strongly to the 51 episodes, and was never based entirely on the manga. The finite number of [app14] is one of its greatest strengths, as storylines that chug on for ages eventually lose steam.Bleach is now in the 160's if I recall correctly, and a large portion of those are rather daft filler [app20] as they try to keep up with the manga that the series is bound to.The stretching out of events in each episode [app20] show feel like its dragging its feet week to week, whereas FMA managed to keep things rolling strongly. Watch other shows like Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann (which had 27 episodes) or Flame of Recca (which had 42) and you can see why a limited number of episodes can [app20] major strength to a series.
Although eBay serves only as a [app2] medium for connecting suppliers with consumers I would say eBay is better from an economic perspective. With no firmly set prices, eBay's [app9] closely resembles an internet-based free market... where consumers pay the prices they are willing to pay and suppliers supply goods for what they are willing to [app18] them for. In otherwords this is a self-targetting market which operates (with the exception of delivery problems) at optimum efficiency.Amazon on the other hand used to use consumer price-targetting, in other words they would raise prices on certain books for certain users they found to be more likely to purchase certain kinds of books. It was only after they were caught that they decided to stop the price targetting. Now they are setting prices based on what the product suppliers are setting them at, they may not be working at optimum efficiency.
final fantasy is better because if you look at it compared to kingdom hearts final fantasy has better graphics and a better story line. i must admit kingdom hearts does have some good features but you fight little black creatures called heartless and grey empty bodys called nobodys. and the biggest ruiner is that you do it all with a key. plus some final fantasy games are turn based but that [app20] it a little better. the final fantasy trilogy has been out since the nes i have played the first final fantasy (the original) so i can honestly say that not only has final [app20] been out longer and had a better run than most games but you cant beat final fantasy 7 on rating any day. also in [app20] hearts 2 you can see tipha sephiroth and cloud but with different names like roxas is [app20] form of cloud. i rest my case.
2 reasons:- Let all babies be wanted babies. Knowing that you were unwanted but the parent was prohibited from getting an abortion can be pretty emotionally devastating to some.- Anyone who doesn't want their baby so much as to have them terminated would not be a good parent. If they could care less about their child, [app18] will grow up uncared for [app20] even abused, malnourished, or neglected.Here's my solution: once you find out you're pregnant (unintentionally), immediately look for an adopter, and if that fails, get an abortion.
I just watched the original debate in the Houses of Parliment on TV (some programme about Tony Blairs legacy) and it made me wonder about this. I have to say that I think if the steps had been taken to secure a [app14] resolution the added benefits of having all seven member nations on board would have averted much of the disasterous nature of engagement and subsequent occupation.
Recently, engineers have recreated the diesel engine. No longer is it the loud smoke chugging brute of an engine. Rather, it now has mileage that rivals hybrids (a new VW diesel car gets 75 miles to the gallon, beating out the Toyota Prius) and has more eco-friendly emissions than ever before.Its not smart to bank our future on fossil fuels and the like forever, however until we [app20] efficient electric/other technologies it seems like a great stepping point.(also, hydrogen as a combustive fuel is being researched right now and seems quite plausible as well)
I don't exactly see how cutting someone's hair, like a child for example, would straighten them out. For most kids, it wouldn't really teach them a "valuable" lesson. I can tell you based on personal experience. If you can properly discipline your child, then there's no reason to cut his/her hair as a punishment. If does come to punishing them, there are better ways for them to learn what [app20] was wrong.
Criminal [app0] are criminal [app1] - regardless of whom they are made up of. If the police is not allowed to protect the population from criminal gangs, regular citizens will take up arms to protect themselves.While it is understandable, this is not good for the rule of law.Therefore, 'political correctness' must not be used to prevent police from doing their jobs and keeping the public safe.
Usually we have a good experience here. On this latest occasion I was disappointed with the service. Food was fine but the lack of attentiveness and overall demeanor of the [app10] will prevent me from coming here for quite awhile. What really fries me is when the bussing of the tables is slow. And that was the case here. Also, instead of letting us relax [app20] drinks the [app20] took our drink and dinner orders at same time. Take the drink order first and let us look at the menus, please. It was a Saturday night (early) and perhaps the staffing was not sufficient.
I'm a regular here and absolutely love this place. It's the best Mexican food I've had in such a very long time. It's family owned, and they are all very personable with their customers. They take the time to spark conversation with you while your order is being prepared--and let me just say their ingredients is so fresh! Their guacamole is my favorite as well as their Horchata. My go to dish is the Carne Asada Fries with Angus [app20] or their Chicken Chimichangas. You honestly can't go wrong with this establishment. I could eat here everyday. And if you have a birthday coming up, the food is on them! I always forget to go in and take advantage but I don't mind paying even if it's the day after. You want to spend a dime for great food, this is your place
We just went over for drinks. Our [app2] the Mac &a Cheese and she said it was really good. She even got some wings to go cuz her man loves them. The outdoor seating was super chill, although that day they allowed some kids to come in and they were definitely obnoxious. Other than that I think it's super cool and chill [app20] hang and drink.
If my spouse [app1] murder I would not [app2] in. I would do the exact opposite I will help him hide all evidence if any, I will move if we had to, and I will never bring it up to his attention again. If my husband killed someone, he knew what he was doing, [app18] or it was for a cost. It would be hard for me [app20] in the one I love.
Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have from him are his absence, and not knowing what he was like. A lousy father could come in gain your trust, and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. To me having a [app18] does nothing is in itself an absence because either way he knows nothing about you, and you nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in [app20] of my life.
This argument could go both ways but I would have to agree with being fatherless because to me a lousy father is a [app7] is never there when you need him to be there or, he is never [app13] listen to what you have to say that's why being fatherless is better in my opinion because you can imagine your father to be [app20] to be and, it makes you a [app20] and a better father.
Definattley all those obese kids need excersise and its a whloe part of [app4] course it should be mandortory.
It is clear that Stamford Raffles was the basis for the idea but the implementation was [app5] Farquhar so i believe he is the rightful [app8] Singapore. Raffles was just the 'idea man' before the founding but was summoned to Bencoolen by his superiors and did not [app16] contribution to the founding of Singapore.
NO. I am a female who watches porn.It does not bother [app3] my boyfriend watches porn.I think its natural for people to have sexual desires.If [app8] uncomfortable with the idea, just don't watch it.But, people who love porn can watch all the videos they want and I see no wrong with that.
Its [app0] have a lousy father then not have one at all. Even if you have a lousy father you can still learn from him. You can tell yourself, "I'm not going to [app11] him, I'm going to be better". Even if you have a lousy father his going to love you no matter what.
I learned English through TV.Technically, I learned English through interaction with native speakers, but TV helped a [app5] than books.
Bottled water is not our biggest problem when it comes to drinking habits. All other beverages consume [app5] of water and energy during their production processes, which makes their ecological impact far more detrimental than that of bottled water. http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&address;=103x347180
People should not hit there kids because [app2] will think it is OK to [app5] someone else back like for an example at school they [app8] up fighting and abusive to others.
Physical education does absolutely nothing for the children's health and/or lifestyle. Let me describe my PE experience.Throughout my public education career, PE has been mandatory [app8] year. This has involved barely moving, standing talking with friends, half-hearted volleyball/dodgeball, yearly physical fitness tests that don't require effort, DDR, bouncing on fitness balls, and, most recently at my arts high school, watching sports documentaries and playing Wii Sports.Unless public education is reformed, health classes can teach children what they need to know about fitness and nutrition, because PE [app20] are severely lacking.
Unfortunately it is human nature to be selfish. This doesn't always mean that you are going to be a mean person and always do what is best for you, but an individual will usually help himself first. Sometimes in a good situation going out on your own personal pursuit does [app16] the common good. Neither is [app18] better but I believe that a personal pursuit might [app20] useful we only live this life for [app20] and we want to be the best we can be. Maybe your personal [app20] the common good.
A personal pursuit is a better endeavor because you are fulfilling something within yourself. It is [app5] help others but there is a time to do so. Achieving a personal goal is a journey to fulfillment where one is truly happy. Before helping others you must remember about yourself, but you must not forget about those who are really in need.
None of [app0] time! but... it is your civic duty to participate now and again! There are specific criteria that will relieve you of jury duty, but you still need to show up and allow the judge to review your petition/request and dismiss you legally. As far as trying to act like a @#$ a..hole in the courtroom and prejudice your responses, be careful-you can be held in contempt and perjury in a courtroom is very expensive!!
It can't be handled in one trial. Theft is criminal, and malicious prosecution and breach of contract are civil. The DA won't touch them. If you don't have a lawyer to bargain with the DA, then your best bet is to sit tight, gather your evidence, and defend yourself at [app16] trial. If the DA wins, your case may be sunk; but if the DA loses you will be in a better position to sue the witness whom you believe lied. You can sue in civil court, and you might be able to sue in Small Claims without a lawyer.
The Computer Misuse Act, Cap 50A, is very clear that if one uses another person's computer service (in this case, someone's broadband connection) without permission, he has committed an offence.I am unsure of the Act's legislation history but the law was around since 1993. From your post, I would assume that your friends made use of the other party's router fairly recently. As such, if they are caught, they can be prosecuted.Arguing that the router is unsecured and/or does not have a unique SSID is futile; it [app20] sense that the router has to belong to somebody and if you are not in a free wireless zone e.g. McDonald's, then one should know that any access [app20] be going through a privately owned network.
In the state of Georgia as of 2006, a child of 17 years of can notmove out of parents home without permission. Unless anotherguardian is appointed or you are amansiapted. Contact your local juvinile office [app11] doubt.The only reason the law [app14] does not enforce this lawis because it would cost millions of dollars to enforce and mostpolice officers are not up to date on juvy laws.Another few months will not hurt if your truly [app20] and you canfinish school to make a brighter future for the two of you. Then just maybe Mom will [app20] for the relationship.Good Luck!!!!Already been there!!!!!!!!!
The first answerer should be correct. I don't know Louisiana law, but I've never [app4] a state putting something like that into law. Instead, it is a common courtesy that employers and employees typically offer two weeks notice before terminating. If you want to maintain a good relationship with your employer, or want a good reference from them later, it's advisable to give two-weeks notice, but I'd be shocked to hear that it is required.
I think it's a good idea. That way, everyone at the school is on the same playing field...at least appearance-wise. Those students who are less fortunate and don't [app9] money to buy clothes or have a lot of clothes don't have to worry about what their going to wear. I think it helps self-esteem and allows them to concentrate more on schoolwork.
No.Any society that values the [app1] a human life and [app3] non-violent solutions would be hypocritical to include capital punishment in their justice system.With a fallible justice system, there is always the risk that innocent people will be executed.Where punnishments are decided by mortals, there is a risk that the harsher sentences are handed out according to prejudice.Where the best barristers are available to those with the most money, there is always a risk that the poor are disadvantaged.
If the male were to sue the female for damages, that is a civil action. The defense of temporary insanity is used in criminal proceedings. It generally would not [app9] to a civil proceeding. However, the defense of temporary insanity is (contrary to what you see on television and the movies) extremely rare. Some states do not allow it at all. Others, just like the "permanent" insanity defense, restrict it considerably. Mental anguish is a tort. I think it unlikely under the circumstances that a jury would give her much for a mental anguish claim. The fact that its a marriage that is obviously in trouble, and he would be able to produce his own evidence, would problably not [app20] case a viable case, IMHO.The laws governing the above vary greatly from state to state. For the most [app20] information, you should consult an attorney who is licensed in your state. If you need a referral, contact your local [app20] bar association.
I've slowly been losing belief in morality. I tend to find the whole thing odd. There's this weird quality that lies outside of the physical realm and cannot be justified by it (because you can't easily leap from something existing to something being moral without something being taken as axiomatic) and yet we are bound by it with threads made up of this also strange material? All moral systems seem to start from an assumption that X is good (and we therefore must do X), and I can't seem to find any reason to believe that I should make that jump. *Why* should I believe in some magical moral rule when the world seems so clearly explicable without it? *Why* should I believe that it's anything but a bunch of illusions created by mammals that need incentives for prosocial behavior? If I place a world with moral meaning [app20] one without the latter seems far simpler with less baggage.CMV please.
1) A HomeNo [app1] be homeless in this world. Everyone deserves to have a [app5] call home, no one should be living on the street.2) FoodEveryone needs food to be able to live. No reason why people should be starving.3) HealthcareEVERYONE should receive equal healthcare regardless of their insurance and money situation. No one should be able to buy better healthcare.4) EducationEveryone should be entitled to getting some sort of education. Im not saying put everyone into college, im just saying that if someone wants [app20] themselves with education, be it getting a basic high school education, a college degree, or some sort of trade, it should be available.This is where [app20] unpopular.The government should pay for it.If we had a tax system that taxed the rich more and the poor less there would be money for programs that, feed, house, educate, and care [app20] single person.
After finishing Reservoir Dogs for the [app2] last night, I have noticed how much of a bullshit move this is. I have heard the usual reasoning and still find no logic in it. They are doing us a service that does not have to be provided to us. They work hard and they usually only get paid enough that it pays for the state and federal taxes applied to the wages. To not tip our servers is a like a slap in the face to them. They rate their performance on how big or small their tips are. Be brutal, kind, or what you want. Just be logical
In the island of Ireland there is football; [app2] kick the ball with your feet and is seen all over the world e.g. FIFA World Cup but there is also Gaelic football. In America there is soccer and football [NFL]. I believe football in America is called football despite being egg shaped is because it is the associated sport of that name in that country, while soccer is the foreign sport.Based of the above; in Ireland the NFL is Gaelic Football as it is played all across the island; Ireland and Northern Ireland [two separate counties]. Soccer is the foreign sport, so why is different?Could it be because of the relationship between the UK and Ireland or maybe their political standings? Either way, depending on what side you are on and who you might be speaking to, football can mean two different things. Football should be the national football of a country, soccer should be the foreign sport. Change my view
I finally got to mid career level management as a woman in my 30s. I am now in a long-distance relationship where there is a pressure to move [app9] my significant other is living and working. We are both in inflexible corporate jobs. I believe although I am pass 30 years old and I do love him, I cannot sacrifice my career anymore for a big move. I dont speak the language he speaks (although I am learning it, I speak it in an elementary level).CMV. What beliefs do you hold that [app20] me move to be with someone I love but which will make me throw away [app20] my home country. What else should I be thinking about for those who have had to make these choices as well?
Powermat is being installed in 100,000 locations around the United States. If the next iPhone has a built in PMA component, then Qi will lose the war. Apple users are often Starbucks and Teavana regulars, so it will be convenient for them. PMA will be installed everywhere for the 50% of smartphone users in the U.S. who own an iPhone and Qi will die. CMV To be clear, I don't want this to happen. I support Qi and I don't like the [app20] transmission (pushed ads) that PMA can do. So I want someone to give me hope for Qi. Please. Thank you.
Basically, I think doing away with offsides in soccer [app3] the game much more exciting. If the teams were both forced to spread across the entire field, everyone has more space, which allows for much more passing, shooting, and generally exciting offensives. I think this would allow for games to [app17] more higher scoring, therefore making it more exciting and more pleasing for the fans. Hardly any games would end in draws, which in my opinion is the most frustrating thing in any sport. Watching an entire 90 minutes only for neither team to win would almost be ended, or at least greatly reduced.
I'll admit it. I'm a fan of Daisy. I know, I know, her voice is irritating, sure. That's your opinion. However, Super Mario Land was the first Mario game I ever beat, and so I have an affinity for her. Beyond that, though, it [app14] reuse her at least once. She's a familiar face to anyone who's ever played Mario Kart since the Gamecube. Moreover, now that Nintendo has a habit of sending Mario to places outside of the Mushroom Kingdom, a la Galaxy or 3D World, it [app20] perfect [app20] bring him back to Sarassaland. It lets Peach be a playable character, it justifies her continued [app20] in spinoffs, and it could [app20] Mario universe more cohesive. So, please, change my view, because it's never going to happen and I don't want do die sad.
All my life I've been fascinated by economics and money. I recall [app4] a lot of time thinking about what qualities a "perfect" money would have, as I see many flaws with the current "candidates" e.g. gold/dollars/euros/etc. In particular, I see a neutral and fixed money as being superior and offering many advantages [app17] we currently use.As a consequence of this, I belief [app20] forces will push direct more and more resources to Bitcoin (from the inferior monies in the market place) until Bitcoin consumes all of their value and becomes a monopolistic global currency. I have done a lot of FMA (failure mode analysis) on this, and I feel very confident in the conclusion that this is inevitable. I've invested my life's savings in Bitcoin. Change my mind?
I don't want this to come across as a humblebrag, but I am studying at university and get good grades. I have achieved mostly First Class grades this semester while my friends get 2:1s and 2:2s. It has become an expectation that I achieve Firsts, and therefore when I do score highly on work I receive replies such as "of course" or "is that it?" jokingly from my peers. I am not trying to be arrogant, but I can't talk to this with any one of the guys on the course. They feel like I should be 'grateful' for my grades, despite the fact I put substantially more [app20] and writing time into the work I submit. In the past I have usually had a peer to compete with, but I am lacking that and I [app20] pressure on me to just keep at the top.I am I just being a dick or am I justified in feeling that my achievements are undermined by people expecting that I get top grades?
Just completed a marathon of the series, and for my money, the first three were just more enjoyable. The story was quite rich; the rise of Palpatine, the clones, Amidala, Anakin, the role of the Jedi... Each arc wasn't just a progression of linear events building up to Episode IV. There were some amazing set pieces too; Darth Maul against Obi Wan and Qui Gon, Anakin vs Obi Wan, Jango Fett.Next to the new ones, the old [app20] seem slow, linear a little dumb.I accept there are plenty of faults with the first three episodes (I'm looking at you, Jar Jar). I also accept that much of what we accept now as standard fare for sci-fi is off the back of Star Wars, but my argument is simply that the first three episodes (in episodic order) more enjoyable and engaging than the latter three.
Tj is smarter than Sheldon because he had an IQ of 180 at the age of 10. He skipped from [app6] 4 to [app7] 10 he [app8] trouble doing the work and also teached the [app12] 10 class and got into arguments with teachers and he was always right. TJ was able to hack into numerous things. He was even on a debate show called Cross Talk and was able to win debates easily with grown adults that [app20] smart maybe as smart a Sheldon.
From the moment I walked in, there was already something wrong with my experience. No one greeted us, so me and my friends (group of 5) decided to find a seat on our own. Once I [app12] down the cook told us they could not serve us because they had no plates. Once we didn't leave after she stated that, she proceeded to make a smart remark to convince us to leave. After she said that, we all left and took our business elsewhere. I don't know why this place is 24 hours if they're not able to function. We went while there was one other customer there! This place was not even busy, if it was busy I would understand why they had no plates. But if they had one other customer in the building, I don't understand why they [app20] plates. Horrible experience and would never go again.
I can't sing new way's praises enough. I live a hop, skip and a jump away from this gem and checked it [app7] the [app8] after some Arsenal workers recommended it on a night they didn't have a food truck. The owner is super friendly, makes everything from scratch and gives you substantial portions at an extremely low price. The place is never too crowded so he is always able to whip up your [app20] meal in no time whilst you window gaze at the busy strip of Penn Avenue outside. The tuscan chicken sandwich was [app20] as well as the hot italian sausage sandwich when it is on special. You really can't go wrong with anything you get there, though. Definitely worth checking out if you are in the neighborhood!
We've gone 2x now and won't be going back again. The first time, it was decent but the steaks were way overcooked. We decided we'd gove them another try [app9] our steaks rare. The second time, it was a 20 min wait to be seated, another [app15] for the food, and when we got it, the steaks were way overcooked again, even though [app20] it rare. The veggies were soggy, the lobster was rubbery. My son, who eats anything you put in front of him, took one bite of his grilled cheese and refused to touch it again. Then we go up front to pay, it takes another 7 mins for someone to come ring us up. She asks how it was and we told her it was awful, she said "sorry, $34.24" we should've just walked out, I wouldn't have felt guilty, it was disgusting.
books are better than TV because TV [app2] you blind. your eyes can also hurt alot if you watch to much.
Although Farquhar was said to be the one who [app3] in Singapore to support its development, Raffles provided the planning, the strategizing, and was the one to select Singapore as another British base, giving early Singapore support of the British. If William Farquhar was to be proclaimed the founder because he did the "grunt work", shouldn't the supervisor of a construction site get the most commission, instead of the contractor? And besides, Raffles left Singapore under the orders of his superiors and he did not leave of free will
Raffles was the person who signed a treaty with the Temenggong and also the Sultan Hussien, and not William Farquhar. I agree that William Farquhar was the one that remained in Singapore to keep it running and also developed it further, but Raffles was the one who gave him [app16] because he had to leave and [app19] to Bencoolen, also, he was the one who laid out the foundation of Singapore's Development, so he should be considered a founder.
I'm not an IE user but FFX has a lot of issuesFirst, it does not start fast when it is loaded from the disk. For my 3 yr old computer, it takes about 10 or more seconds to start it, unlike the browser I use Opera it takes much less time to start.Plug-ins i [app18] use such as Adobe Flash Player does not perfrom well in FFX. The flash movie often stops in FX unlike in Opera which plays flash movies smoothly.Lastly, Firefox is still young. I guess it is much better than IE. But for me Opera is still the best.
If a woman is raped [app1] with the bastard child of the man who raped her and severely emotionally traumatized her, she should have the [app8] give up that baby. Certain circumstances call for desperate decisions and this is one, the choice should be her's to make and she should be allowed to make it.
There's no concrete evidence that supports that god exists.Religion and the bible have too many contradictions and changes that I become less and less convinced in his existence...Evolution makes more [app10] me.Animals adapt to their environment, and over [app13] of time will evolveto be able to survive through different climates and situations.
I think the common [app1] a better endeavor, because it's [app3] give [app4] receive. It's better to give other people you're hand out in help then you holding your own hand.
Both endeavors are better to be part of.But I as an individual I would like to [app5] common good in this society to become unpetty with each other,to do things way better [app11] use to.Everyone in this world knows what they want to be. To be alone pursuing their dreams without the help of others, but some other will help the community to make it safe and better.To teach them what they are capable of,to beleive in themselfs that they can do as the things wealthy people does.
advancing the common [app1] better to me because, If i were to pursue my own personal pursuit, it wouldn't be all that good, because most of them would be selfish choices that woulld end up hurting someone else, i dont like hurting people. It would be a much better world if we thought about everyone else well being before we think about our selves.
Student victimization is likely to be lowered and fights and gang activity should be decreased, [app5] is less competition in regard to wearing the most fashionable clothing.
It would be [app1] have a lousy father than to not a have a [app5] all. If you were to grow up with out a father you would always have that empty void feeling about it. And if your father is lousy it helps you strive to be better than him. It could also cause you to start being responsible faster because the father isn't taking care of business. Like me and my brother, my father is lousy but I'm still happy i know who he is. Just because i cant imagine wondering about it.
Over 1.5 million barrels of oil were used to [app3] plastic bottles consumed in the US last year-and that doesn't include the petroleum used to transport them. That's enough petroleum to power 100,000 automobiles for a year.
In New York City alone, the transportation of bottled water from western Europe released an estimated 3,800 tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere. In California, 18 million gallons of bottled water were shipped in from Fiji in 2006, [app13] about 2,500 tons of global warming pollution.
Do we have the potential?Yes.The only [app2] we have is China who has done a much better job for [app6] run.But then again the way India runs.. it always makes order out of chaos.
I am a Christian for I believe there is a just God who will do ultimate justice for the good and bad [app7] done here on earth.
Since he knew about it, did not [app2] court at that time, let alot of time go past, the court will view this [app8] as allowing it.But he will have to [app11] court to find her in contempt, and order her to [app15] to the state.alot better chance had it done it prior to her moving, or as soon as she moved.
I believe that you have to put a fence around any pool in Ohio. Lets put it this way- if you dont put a fence around your pool, and a little child sneaks in and drowns- you would be completely liable, and would likely lose your house, your car, and have your wages garnished for years while you worked to pay off the [app20] lawsuit. To me, the risk isnt [app20] reward, I would install [app20] matter what the law is (but yes, I think every pool in Ohio requires one). Also, if you dont have a fence around it, you might have problems with your homeowners insurance over the liability issue as well.
I don't think so. I'm sure he's not the first student to think of this. It's a given. You're taking a test to show what you have learned. Obviously he's learned nothing!That would [app11] getting [app12] on your heart and after the doctor says, "oh you wanted it done correctly? Well, you didn't say that".Tell him to take the energy he's scheming with to STUDY!
When your time on earth is over, to the extent that people remember you fondly, and are changed for having known you, you have made a difference. I rest all of my hopes on the upbringing of my children. If I am a good father, and I believe I am, my children will be positively affected throughout their lives by the values I have taught and the [app20] I have provided. I also try to do so through various mentorship programs for those whose reality would be darker but for my involvement. I am satisfied that my involvement in all of these people's lives will have made a difference, and that they are better off having known me [app20] would have been otherwise.
Although mergers of big companies are carefully analyzed before getting a green light, so as to not distort competition by creating a single company with too much power, the purchase of smaller companies by big companies is not considered problematic, even if [app14] of the small company is huge. For example the acquisition of Whatsapp by Facebook gave Facebook a huge amount of personal information, which is Facebook main business model, putting it in a leading position to sell this data. However, not only has there not been any analysis of the merger, I also feel some right of our has been violated, the moment Facebook gained the right to do as it wishes with my [app20] without my consent and without giving me an [app20] opt out and delete the data. Just because I trusted company A with my [app20] does not give company B, the buyer, my trust.
I own an AK-47 with a 10 round magazine as well as a .40 caliber Springfield Armory hand gun that holds 12 rounds. My view is that someone can take out just as many people with a hand gun as they would [app14] "assault rifle". IMO handguns would be more dangerous because they are easily concealable. AK-47's and AR-15's are considered assault rifles even though they can't shoot any faster than any other semi-automatic weapon (legally). Just because they look scary doesn't mean they are more dangerous. What say you?
In both of these events a country lost territory which rightfully belonged to its people.In both cases, an authority felt the need of land-grabbing, one secured their military base, the other ~~wanted their holy land back~~ also secured their military presence.Both of these events caused and continue to cause ultimately unnecessary instability within Ukraine and Palestine. This naturally leads to deaths.Yet, because of superpowers involved it's common to make this an issue about taking sides with [app20] US or Russia, when the countries essentially did the same thing.
Pretty much what it says in the title. I'll explain further by saying that I believe that government is a good thing, the [app7] of society when done right, and taxes are the natural cost of having a good government. While high taxes do not [app15] mean a good government, I believe a good government needs high taxes in order to pay for the services, personnel, and resources that entails.So what am I missing? Why is a good government a government that governs least, [app20] needs less money? Who ever [app20] a structures that does it's purpose best by doing it least.I don't get it. Please help me get it.
Anything we consider [app1] based on the artist's ability to match something within us that evokes an emotion. Many of the [app7] we consider beautiful outside of the realm of art (e.g. fractals, algorithms, arguments) are things whose patterns are inherent, or which describe something else in an elegant manner.I would argue that the part of our mind that experiences beauty does so in reaction to the identification of a pattern, either external or internal to our self.
One cannot decide whether or not one sex is greater in intelligence than the other. It will all depend [app6] individial themself. There may be a group of males that are of high intelligence. There may [app12] a group of males that are very low in intelligence. This may [app17] happening within the females. Some females may be high in intelligence while others are not so fortunate. This being said, with all of the highly intelligent individuals from each sex and all of the non-intelligent people from each sex, they even out each others intelligence in which makes them of equal intelligence.
Although it is not technically correct (Web 2.0 is not a new technical iteration of the WWW), the mass adoption of a technology requires two important things: 1) A technology that works and 2) a hook that the audience and business adopters can understand. Web 3.0 is a name that people will be able to relate to, mass marketers can use it etc etc.I know its a flimsy argument and it will irritate a lot of people, including me, if it happens BUT it's a name that works better than Semantic Web - SW is not the kind of name you see on cereal boxes.
Pretty terrible, especially comparing [app1] burrito places like Burito Boyz or Fat Bastard burrito. I [app5] grilled veggie burrito, with lots of hot sauce. The hot sauce didn't help, and the fillings [app11] bland. It was definitely cheaper than the other, cost me about $7 for the regular size burrito, but tasted so bad I'd obviously much rather pay more for a good burrito! Would definitely not recommend.
My husband (the American and stingy with his stars) has had his fair share of NY deli meats (pastrami/corned beef) so I was a bit nervous about bringing him here since for me their smoked [app11] is simply the best. He tried it and loved it! So much so that we had [app17] before we left Montreal, but this time taking it out (don't [app20] long lines ruin your experience!).
I was less than impressed by my tea experience at Jade Mountain. I looked for a [app5] stop in Madison while on a business trip and found this place. I had planned to do some work in the tea shop but it [app14] warm in the space and didn't seem like a place I could get anything done. The tapioca pearls were fantastic and clearly [app20] so that was good. I got a mango fruit tea and it was just too sweet and there was no [app20] in it so it got warm fast with the warm tapioca pearls. The tea was much better when I was able [app20] into it. The kid who helped me didn't seem to excited to be there or particularly helpful for a first-timer like me and I was a little disappointed to get a regular lid instead of the fun shrink wrapped cup to stab the straw into like I find at most bubble tea shops. This was good but not great.
Burgers are good but just not [app2] price.Ordered the holy smokes with frees and a can of pepsi. Can't remember the exact price but it was nearly $20!! Burger was indeed very good and the portion of fries [app13] hefty so that was a plus, they were also pretty good.The only thing I'm having trouble with is how they justify [app20] for what is essentially a takeaway burger place. I've had [app20] in restaurants that were cheaper!I'd give it 4 stars if based just on the food but have to give it 3 because of the price. Probably wouldn't get [app20] because of that.
K O'Donnells is definitely the [app1] be! When it comes to food, this place has everything! You can't go wrong with anything on this menu. Not only do they have the stellar food, they have an award winning doggy patio! I bring my dog very frequently to socialize with other dogs. If your looking for a stellar happy hour come in from 3-7 and get some food and [app20] cold beers! You can't go wrong with the [app20] specials and those speciality martini's!
Frequent customer at this chipotle! It is nice and close to my house. It is located near the happy valley round about which can get super [app8] when everyone is getting off work so we like to go early or a little later to avoid the rush. It's also [app16] so [app17] gets lunch especially at lunch [app19] is typically pretty fast. Good food and great customer service. The [app20] Thomas is [app20] and so friendly. He recognizes my fiancé and I as frequent [app20] and always greets us and asks us about our day.I switch off from a burrito and bowl. With my burrito I ask them to mix it up and it's so delicious! I also get half chicken half steak so I get the best of both worlds for 1 price. Love having a healthy quick [app20] go eat lunch or dinner. Would definitely recommend this to others (: Oh and 1 thing I don't like.... it's always super cold in here. Haha so bring a jacket.
Firefox takes the best of all previous browsers and sticks it all in one neat package. Security and extendibility are some of its top features. And those times when FF seems to eat up a lot of memory? That's just the cache so you're able to surf the [app16] even faster. Just lower the cache if you don't want to eat so much memory.
To be able to have a succeful trading port you must have good contacts with many people and raffles had those contacts without him we would not have a trading port at all! I would like to mention that raffles had all the important qualities of a founder and he was in good position to do so. He invested a lot and we therefore credit him as our founder! We say Obama is the "founder" of health reform WHY because he was in such a high position and he could do something like [app20] money time and effort in such a project.
Most of the government sites in India is designed only for IE, so it is [app5] have IE in your computer
Everybody has [app0] and [app1] they want to accomplish in life. However, a person that helps the community and puts other people in front of themselves will most surely live a better life. If you really think about it, advancing the common [app14] basically a win-win situation. You get the support of other people, and you can also get recognition for yourself as a reward for your help.
Well personally I think that personal [app2] better. No reason really, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if im looking [app9] myself instead of the whole world. If i focus on my [app13] then someday I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about in return helping me even more.
In a school all the students may not belong to the same financial status . Some may be rich , some may not be that rich . So uniform provides equal status to all the students so that there is no gap among them . If there is no uniform , then the rich students will wear new dresses [app19] which the other students cannot afford and may lead to resentment among them .Some insensitive children may also mock other students wear old cloths .So I beleive that uniform is essential especially in developing countries .
I would much rather have a lousy father that a [app3] because every dad out there is lousy in their own kind of way. I don't always agree with my dad, we don't always get along, and sometimes, when he gets home from work, [app15] sits on the couch, watching tv, and waits for my mom to make him food. Thats pretty lousy to me, but at the end of it all, I love him and I don't know what I would do without him. Yeah, he'll get on my nerves sometimes, but he's lived longer than me which makes him wiser in so many different ways.
The Indian economy is galloping at a breakneck speed and might even reach double-digit [app4] by 2013, feel Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee and Commerce Minister Anand Sharma. Many economists agree that the demographic dividend that India enjoys could see the country sustain its high growth rate for a [app16] to come.The India [app17] story is indeed enviable. Despite being plagued by myriad problems, India has emerged stronger and more resilient to any global crises so far.India is expected to be the world's fastest growing economy by 2018, according to Economist Intelligence Unit, a research arm of the Economist magazine.
I say yes because children are getting more and more violent and they need to get [app5] if they [app6] act up.
Yes , because if they are afraid of getting spanked then they won't do [app4] . The parent should only spank them and not go over board and keep [app10] them .
Yes I would be happy and relieved [app2] my [app3] for murder. Killing someone is the one number one crime in this world. I don't want to stay married to a crazy woman who commits murder. I wouldn't feel safe if we have [app15] the house or sleeping [app17] her. I wouldn't be able to sleep or think [app20] months, maybe years.
I would say yes to that because my wife would be a murderer. A murderer as a spouse is not the happiest life you can bring upon your self, [app9] you would have so much stress about when the cops might break in and take you for affiliating with a crime scene or even if your own life is in danger. So from these reasons I would [app20] spouse in.
I would have to say yes. She [app2] murder, a thing that can get you in major trouble, even if you're an accompalice. I don't care what the reason was, it could have been accidental, there could have been someone trying to attack her, or whatever, she killed someone. The second she tells me, I wil call the police, just in case she either goes on another killing spree or decides to kill me
I dont think many countries consider men with men acceptable. It's almost always taboo in society/main religions. I doubt as a whole people will ever really accept the union as a union under god.However, they should accept it as a legal union of two people living together, because that's what they're doing. Ignorant people seem to get these two mixed.It's their business what happens under the sheets.
The difficulty in answering yes and no questions is not so much the specific [app4] the honest answer, but the implications of that answer. The only way to [app9] is to give the correct answer, and then have the defense attorney cross examine for the full explanation. Do you like chocolate [app17] cream? Yes or no. The asnwer does not imply that you do not like vanilla. So it [app20] personal and embarrassing questions too. It is the implication of the answer that is the problem.
Most countries where abortion is legal, as far as I know, accept it only during the first three months of pregnancy, where the foetus isn't even properly termed a 'foetus' but rather an 'embryo' (I think). If you've ever seen pictures, it doesn't look anything like a human yet and it has no brain function [app18] can feel no pain and has no awareness of its existence (for anybody wanting to ask 'how can you be sure?', all I can say is that I'm not - this is only what I've read). Well before birth, a foetus has become very much a human being (though not [app20] can survive independently) and then it is a crime to remove it.Please remember that very few people who have had abortions see the question as black-and-white as many anti-choice people do. Every one of them wrestles with their own morals and conscience in their own way.
You could probably file a defamation of character lawsuit. I doubt the police would do anything about this. However, a lawsuit would be expensive and messy [app8] parties. You're better off letting it slide, [app11] high road and living your life honorably, [app14] these people are petty and not worthy of your attentions.Light always shines through the darkness and I'm sure the people who know you are [app20] of your character.
This is a Left at the gate horse. I am a person to whom the reading of a law book is as simple as reading a comic book. First you would need a lawyer to win. That constitutional right about bringing your own case is wiped out by judges who do not want to be bothered by non-lawyers. Second you would need evidence that the persons actions caused you "Increased anxiety" As the tesimony of a theripist. Then it would depend on your stat laws. This is a hard case to prove, you might even have to prove the person should have known their actions would harm you.Get ahold of either Legal aid, or [app20] Generals office to see if they have [app20] on how you [app20] the elements of a winning case.
You won't receive a warrant, I'm sure one has been issued, but they are not required to notify you that a [app7] has been issued. Call the court and make payment arrangements. You'll have to pay the original fine, plus warrant fees, possibly interest and whatever else the local laws allow them to tack on. Or you can just ignore it and the [app20] you get stopped for a simple traffic violation you can get arrested for an outstanding warrant.
If they're in [app1] and you're driving, then yes. I don't know about Illinois, but in California you're responsible for the passengers in [app8] minors or not. If one of your passengers isn't wearing a seatbelt, you can get a ticket in addition to them getting one, even if they're an adult. When they're not in [app19] (or even just if you're not driving it) you're not responsible for them unless you and their parents sign something saying you are.
Ok. You have to be careful on how you play your game here because if he can prove that anything you say about him is untrue he may have grounds for his deformation suit.If he has wronged you, there are a couple of things you can do:1. Sue him for the wrong he did to you. 2. Contact the better business bureau in your area3. Report what he did to the government group that regulates car dealers in your area4. Contact the TV station in your area that does customer [app20] reporting.
Yes.You can be emancipated if you're not pregnant, but certainly it provides a judge with a fairly obvious reason to approve the request. I did it...It took about 30 minutes of completing the forms, a couple of signatures, and 5 minutes in front of the judge. Fairly easy, really.And certainly, I do recommend it, if you're going to need to be the one who signs for things on behalf of your child. Most people won't question you, but it's good to have in your back pocket, just in case.
I believe our lives are our own and no one has the right to take it, except ourselves. If the pain, suffering and lack of hope is so unbearable, [app9] have the right to end his or her own life, being it by himself/herself or by asking someone else to do it. For example, my country sends to jail everyone who fails a suicide attempt, which I think is ridiculous for obvious reasons.And if the person isn't able to do it on his/her own, asking someone to do it, either by ending her life through "direct" methods such as a painless poisoning or by "indirect" methods such as turning off the machine that keep that person's heart beating.PLEASE keep in mind I'm talking about VOLUNTARY EUTHANASIA, not non-voluntary euthanasia or involuntary euthanasia. Change my view.
Look at the brain from a physical/chemical perspective. Neurons are fired when we see/smell/hear/touch/taste things. Those neurons interact with other neurons via chemical [app7] that are well understood. Those neurons interact with more neurons, and so on, and so on... Eventually motor neurons are triggered which cause us to [app16] to the sensory input. In no part of this process can I see a way to affect the chain reaction of neurons in any way.Sure, each of our brains is put together differently and that [app20] each of us will respond differently to similar stimuli. But given the EXACT same situation our brains will react exactly the same way to the [app20] stimuli every time. So essentially, you never had a choice.
*EDIT* In [app0] diabetics, people on ventilators and dialysis, and people with organ transplants would die relatively quickly. There is nothing to be done for these people.For this view, I'm simply looking at Type I diabetics. It is estimated that 1% of the US population is a type I diabetic, so 3 million people. Without an industrial system to make the insulin they need, they will all be dead within days or weeks. It is impossible to manufacture insulin outside of the industrial system. The history of type I diabetics before the modern times has been that they simply die as they slip into a diabetic coma.Is there any way to manufacture insulin outside of an industrial system? If not, then I think 3 million type I diabetics will be dead within weeks of a total industrial collapse.
I understand there is a lot of disdain towards people who post a question or an image that has been posted before, however I personally think it's a good thing that people do that.It's true that the person posting the question could easily do a search of previous posts and get their questions answered. However that deprives all the viewers of seeing an answer if they never thought of that question in the first place.Let me give you an example, I'm a huge fan of /r/askhistorians however I've never asked a question on there. I rely on others thinking of interesting questions I wouldn't have thought about and then reading the answers to them. It works much the same with many other subs. As there's no easy to way to view historic posts unless they are "top", unless things are reposted then there's no way [app20] who didn't see it the [app20] to see it again.
I am a professional Software Engineer working for some of the big boys in the software field.

This whole smoking prohibition in public places is overrated, why can’t it just be a matter of decency, if a smoker is among nonsmokers then he shouldn’t smoke, if he have to then [app11] can go smoke a cigarette in the toilet or something like that, I [app16] we involve manners in this issue we won’t have a problem at all.
Filtered, no. Standardized, yes.There should be domain extensions (y'know the .com, .net, .org, ...) that are specific to "unsavory" industries. So, porn sites should all be required to use a .xxx extension so that a router can be programmed to [app13] all incoming connections from a .xxx site. This way parents can [app17] a whole group of sites by blocking domain extensions.
Yes, it isn't that tough, my grandma got married for about 50 and that only ended because she died. I've been married for 7, Johnny Cash was married to June Carter for more than 40, George Takei has been with the same guy for almost 30, people do it all the time. This world is filled with hardship, trouble, pain, financial crises, toil, so it becomes that much more [app20] be with someone who is special and who loves you even in your darkest hours. I might seem like a cynic and a skeptic but there is nothing I believe in more than I believe in love, [app20] of my parents, [app20] of my siblings, [app20] wife, [app20] of my kids, and [app20] that I feel for all of them in return.
The Bush administration and now John McCain equate any negotiation or active diplomacy with enemy governments or countries/political [app6] they consider as terrorist to be useless at best. He supports his position by comparing any attempts to talk to Hamas or Iran or other terrorist groups as "foolish delusion" and equates diplomacy to “the false comfort of appeasement” of the Nazi's.My feeling is that this position actually weakens the USA. It's time the government of the USA realizes we can talk to Cuba, Iran or Hamas as part of a comprehensive foreign policy approach and that be shutting the door on diplomacy we actually encourage aggression against the USA.
...rather than informative news coverage. Sorry about that.Well, what do you think? The media has become a breeding ground for industry and rich businessman with cigars. They no longer inform. Is anyone reminded about the 1976 movie "The Network". I have heard about it, and that can be displayed as evidence that, today, [app17] is no longer the news. It's all for the television ratings, and to get them, they need to use ridiculous tactics.
Ate here this past Friday and the food was delicious! Something that really stood [app4] me was the F'n Loaded Sliders. Filet Minion mixed with blue cheese and a bottom less basket of garlic fries! It was so good and the prices are not what you'd expect for such a [app17] meal. Your getting P.F Chang's but without the hit to your wallet and in my opinion way better food. We can't wait to go back!
This is one of my favorite places to grab a late afternoon snack on the weekends. I love that you can order half size of the appetizers ... perfect when you want something light, or you like variety (like me). My wife and I usually will bring our pooch, sit out on the patio overlooking Uptown, and split 1/2 order of the cheesy-crab dip and 1/2 order of [app20] nachos. The crab dip with [app20] is incredible. You definitely won't be disappointed. For 1/2 an order of nachos, you'd be surprised at how big they are!I've been here for lunch and gotten [app20] and [app20] (it's OK, [app20] as good as the NYC food-truck [app20] it tries to impersonate),the fish tacos (awesome choice), and also for dinner with some kind of chicken dinner. This is a great choice, and one a nice day, you cannot beat that location and view on the patio!
This is probably the worst ribeye steak I have ever had. No seasoning and really over cooked when we requested medium well. The service wasn't the best either...it wasn't busy, but it took a [app11] to get our food...and our server forgot to put in our order for the kids so they ended up just eating our French fries. We decided we'd just forego the additional wait and go somewhere else to eat. At least the set up was neat and the kids had a great time playing outside!
I dont believe i would [app1] of love.But i certainly would not stay with her; i would move away from her as far as i could.For the simple reason i wouldnt want to be involed with the crime, because i knew about it.
Many people struggle with being fatherless. It is a challenge but it allows them to be [app5] and dependant on themselves. Being fatherless is hard but when it comes down to it, it is [app11] than to have a lousy father. If you had a lousy father, they teach you the wrong things and don't allow you to expand.
If you hover over IE7's tabs, the tooltip has the [app3] title and address.Firefox 2.0 just has the title.Internet Explorer 7 has title and address.
IE [app0] easier to use. It also is more visually pleasing. It is much more [app5] as well.
It should be mandatory because being active and getting involved in sports, even through PE, helps children develop good habits later on in life. Plus, there's the benefit of working together as a team that doesn't always happen in other classes.
The people [app0] William Farquhar as the founder because he was [app3] deal with the country's problems when Raffles failed to be there for them. William Farquhar even took money out of his own pockets to resolve certain issues. When he was forced to leave, the people sent him off with sorrow in their hearts.
While I personally do not think that abortion is right in any way shape or form. I do not believe the government has the right to make that decision. This is a [app10] be made by the parents of the unborn child. NOT the government.
Advancing the common [app1] much better. From the very first day our parents or our teachers have taught us about team work.The whole point of doing community service is about the common good. We have to help others in order to help our selves.
I think that it will be [app2] have an lousy father [app4] father. A least you have an father. You know who he is and where he is. You will also kinda get an idea on what you going to be when you go up. If he is an lousy father, that will help you not be what he is. You can say that it is [app20] that will help you became an better father. Because you don't want to be like your father. You want to better that your father, in-fact that should motivate you to be the greatest father you can be.
I would have to choose a lousy father. I think having a father figure around even though he might not do much for [app7] the family is better than none. A father to me plays a huge role in a childs life he keeps thing stable throughout your childhood. My father is pretty lousy but he does support me and helps out sometimes I would rather have a father than none.
TV ,,!! because you can get [app2] from different resources in a short time ,,, but Books you must read a lot to get that much of [app9] !!
A parent shouldn't use [app1] as an [app2] a child because they might grow up traumatized and they might feel unloved since they would get spanked a lot, that will cause a low self of esteem. Also spanking shouldn't be an option because at that moment the parent would be full with anger and they wouldn't be thinking logically.
Personal [app0] better because people will be people and want to be the best they can be and they want to be on the top. I know I want to be a "winner". Which by this happening it means that someone has to be a loser. This is personal pursuit.
I believe it is more [app1] have personal [app3] if [app4] want to begin to help others you have to help yourself. It's not bad to want to help the common good but if you're always putting other people before yourself you may start [app15] about your own needs and wants in life. But I do think that you can have a balance of both.
I believe that Personal [app1] better because its more about [app3] it is about other people. if you cant focus on you personally how can you focus or help others around you. I'm not saying advancing the common [app13] bad at all. I'm just saying that its better to focus on yourself.
No, they can't force you to however, it may impair your credibility so you can instead make an affirmation. I do not "believe in god" either, I also will not swear an oath to any state or government either. Many legal [app13] require a notary seal, I refuse their oath so, instead i make only a documented affirmation, it works and is completely legal.(saves on notary [app20] to boot)
Looks like you're afraid of him having rights to raise this child should you die. If you don't [app6] to have rights to is child, you'll need to get him to sign a legal document signing his rights away.Of course if he does sign his rights away he won't be liable for child support.Check with your local social services office & ask them... "If he signs away his rights to this child will /can the back child support still be collected?"...Yes, do bring him forth & establish paternity.
I am not American, I am Canadian and very proud of that fact.There are things I admire and envy about the USA< but then on the other side there are also things I do not appreciate or admire. This war in Iraq is one of them...I think it was a huge mistake to go in and do what they have done. The civilian casualties are such a shame!
Civil rights- we are innocent until proved guilty, and having everyone on a database would be [app5] opposite stance- like, 'you are a criminal waiting to step out of line'- terrible! It could even have a reverse effect- like, 'they reckon I'm a criminal already, so why not do crime?' We still have the right to privacy to an extent, and having all our details on a database, microchipping us when we haven't done anything wrong, that be a huge violation of personal rights. Still, the biometric ID card will be similar to the system you are suggesting. We'll see if the crime rate goes down... Even if you have everyone on a database, [app20] monitor the people who monitor the database?
I think people sent to prison for drug abuse should be in rehab centers. Note, that's drug abuse, not selling drugs. Drug dealers should have prison time, but the punishment should fit the circumstances.If the drug abuser commits crimes to feed his/her addiction, then jail time for [app15] activity, followed by rehab for the drug abuse.As for murderers and rapists, I think the sentencing needs to be harsher. And capital punishment needs to be enforced better than it is. 30 years of appeals and going through the legal system for a capital murder is too long for justice to be meted out.
Go out and join law enforcement. If you have the education and the training, you should do fine.However, be [app6] that the people who you will deal with are living a different reality than you and me. They operate on the law of the jungle. The strong survive and power means everything. I happened to be a tall, strong law [app20] officer and I rarely have a suspect fight me. They have told me my size made them think twice before fighting. If you are small in nature, you may have to fight more. And keep in mind, most of the [app20] will have [app20] more back-up [app20] with you. Citizen who see us three or more deep arresting someone don't realize that we bring a lot of officers out to avoid fights. We know the nature of these people.With that said, all of the smaller officers I know are fully capable of doing this job. Just be [app20] of what you might be getting in to.
Without going into great detail, if you listen they say "You have the RIGHT to [app5] silent" It's just the that it's their right to not have to say anything. And when you are being questioned you aren't always a criminal, remember you must be proven guilty, but you are first innocent. At the time when they are questioning them they are suspects. Also i'm sure if a suspect didn't want to talk, but was forced to do so, they [app20] up a lot of junk and waste the polic officers time anyways
If the person is mentally handicapped and can prove it-(Doctor supported diagnosis) then I don't suppose the person should be prosecuted. BUT, if someone is supposed to be taking care of or has guardianship of the mentally handicapped person, they may be held liable for not fully supervising. I also think HUNGER is a mitigating circumstance in any food theft issue. If it isn't, it should be.
I believe that this solves a number of issues that I have with the death penalty, amongst other benefits.* The state's hands are kept clean.* An innocent person will always choose the imprisonment, during this time new evidence may come to light that proves them innocent. No more dead innocents.* The convicts freedom of choice remains intact, which I consider to be important.* I believe that presenting them with a choice is more human than executing them against their will.* If they choose the life imprisonment, then they should be presented the option again every five years or so. This way the life [app20] is not inhumane as there is always an "out".* The method of suicide should be left up to the convict.* No other people have to bear the burden of ending someone's life.
You have no control [app1] city or country you're from like you have no control over what colour your skin is. It seems silly to me to cheer for somebody simply because of where they're from and not how they play. Example: Im Canadian (so will obviously use hockey), Montreal Canadiens are the only Canadian team left in the Stanley cup race. Almost everybody I know has started cheering for them simply because they are the Canadian team left in the race. I feel the same for people passionately cheering for a team for their whole life. I find it closes the individuals mind to how good another team could be performing and pass it off as luck when really it's just their blinding biased.
It has become [app1] clear that the country doesn't work for the betterment of its citizenry and I don't see it moving in the direction of ever reaching some sort of an equilibrium in which it does.The culture there just continue to go in the wrong directly of idolization and total submission and people become more and more programmed to accept that with generations. People are working and are barely able to sustain themselves.I believe the two countries should be united and South Korean system should be accepted.This coming from a pinko commie is a difficult thing to state but I think this would be the better outcome than continuing the way it is going. How this is to happen is not really a concern of the topic posted.
Polyamory has been popping up in the media a lot recently and I tend to read the comments on these articles. They do not tend to be, on the whole, positive, with people just tending towards "Nope" or "Ick" type comments.I'm in a polyamorous relationship with two men, so I've got a dog in this fight. We live together. They're not in a sexual relationship with each other. We are happy, healthy, stable and long-term.Tell me, what is objectively wrong about my relationships? And yes, yes, I know it's not for everyone; that's not an argument in itself.
All of my grandparents were born somewhere from the late 1920's to the end of the 1930's and according to most of what I've heard marriage was just "something they did". Society, for whatever reason, just expected them too get married young and have loads of children. According to most of what I've been told, people were married at [app19] by their mid-20's and even that was considered late. Divorce at this time was unheard of, so if your partner changed, (as most people do) then you were just kind of stuck with someone you didn't like. I don't believe that someone is cognitively ready to make a lifelong decision at that age and most people of this time period got married to pacify their parents, society, whatever in an outdated social institution that was just left over from the middle ages. I know it sounds really grim so CMV?
This is partly inspired by the "new look" Ronald McDonald that was unveiled on Twitter recently. I feel that companies who use cartoon or clown characters as part of their marketing strategy to kids are unethical. They establish an early link [app13] impressionable minds that these [app15] are fun and safe. When a person reaches adulthood, the link becomes permanent -- and they still consume these products out of a sense of childhood nostalgia. I'm open to the idea that there might be flaws in my logic here. So please come and change my view!_____
_____I'm an Australian, and I am massive sport lover. I love watching any sport, even the Winter Olympics. However, I cannot understand the massive following for Baseball and American Football. I've tried to sit through full games, but I find there is a severe lack of fluency and action in both sports. I feel like that I am missing or not appreciating something about these sports, and that if I was made aware of some uncovered aspects then I would enjoy them a lot more. Are these sports really that exciting? Or is it more that they have been ingrained in the American culture so much so that the attractiveness and appeal of the actual game is an after thought? Please change my view, as I would love to get involved. They are spoken about regularly in Australia.
I never tip, I think It reinforces the notion that employers can get away with paying a sub standard wage to people based on their chosen occupation, I think tipping should be abolished and in it's place employers should be legally obligated to pay. Realistic and survivable wage then if people [app17] tip then it should go directly to the server. I've never understood why employers are allowed to pay 2$ an hour and society is expected to pay their employees wages while they soak up more profit by avoiding paying their employees a realistic livable wage, and I don't feel anyone should be guilted into paying X [app20] on top of [app20] at a restaurant to pay the servers wage wen it should be their employers
Many communities (e.g. Less Wrong, MIRI) and books (Our final invention) have popped up in the last few years attempting to combat a potential AI doomsday situation (also smart people Elon Musk, Hawking have made comments). Now I am not talking about robots taking jobs or military AI systems gunning people down. I mean Bostrom's paper clip machine scenarios. That is, you have AI system that you give some objective, and it takes over everything, improving itself, rearranging your atoms to its will, [app20] fulfill what seemed like a mundane objective function of making paperclips. Anyway, I do not think this kind of universal optimizer is the trend in AI research. To me it seems the focus (with deep learning etc) is on imitating the cortex's memory system and building really powerful classifiers. I'm [app20] we shouldn't theorize potential disaster, but I think the current fear is overblown CMV
Sure, some brand styling choices could be understood, but in almost 40 years we have figured out what a general purpose all-around video game controller should be. 2 thumbsticks, four thumb buttons on the right, an 8-way directional pad on the left, two bumper buttons, and two triggers.So why the different placement of the directional pad [app18] stick for Microsoft and Sony when the controllers are functionally identical in every other way?I think there is a superior layout, (which one I think it is, is irrelevant) [app20] of the companies simply can't budge because of stubbornness.Edit: Thanks for the replies, guys.
This is in relation to the most recent Indian election in which the Hindu Nationalist Narendra Modi won in a landslide. I can see nothing good in Narendra Modi in [app10] term. Although it may be true that he has a good economic record in Gujarat he will destroy the religious toleration for which India is famed. It would be far better to retain Congress, who although they are as corrupt as all hell are not responsible for the massacre of Muslim Pilgrims (the 2002 Gujarat riots where up to 2000 Muslim pilgrims were massacred and Modi was accused of complicity).Aside from this specific instance, is it better to be tolerant and corrupt than effective and intolerant in the abstract?
I did not create this topic, but I would support the decriminalization of marijuana as long as it would still be illegal to sell or advertise it to minors and as long as it is not used while operating automobiles/heavy machinery.There would be several benefits to legalizing marijuana:1) People who were arrested for using marijuana would be given a second chance to re-enter the work force.2) Due to the fact that there will [app20] prisoners, the [app20] will pay less to upkeep the prison system.3) Federal/state governments will gain revenue by taxing marijuana as all goods and services are.Keeping marijuana illegal indirectly reduces of the [app20] of it, but does not reduce the demand. In result, [app20] of marijuana increases and the drug industry finds profit in selling it illegally on the black market.I know people mean well by supporting the illegalization of marijuana (and other drugs) but prohibition of victimless activities does more harm than good.
Actually this is a good thing for the economy in the long run. China has been keeping its [app6] really low so that it can continue to provided really cheap goods to the US. If the Dollar gets low enough in comparison however, Chinese goods will become more expense hurting American consumers in the short term but ultimately strengthening the domestic market for US producers.But it will get worse before [app20] better.
Went here for dinner on my last night in Montreal over the summer. It seemed to be pretty popular, and was packed on this particular night. We got a [app9] and got to ordering. Pricing is tricky, as sometimes the things you order and get doesn't show up, but there's a fixed charge on your bill. It would be better to see individually, but since it's all-you-can-eat, it's only one. Plus, this night, there was a lot of wrong orders. Things that one [app20] went to another table and vice versa. Sushi was good though, but I felt like they charged us more than what we got and ordered.
Finally! The new space is phenomenal, and we didn't think the food could get any better, but....It did! Had the rib taco and the brisket taco - Outstanding. Also had the slaw and the black beans, so [app12] and tasty. They know how to cook. Really. Thanks. You may want to call ahead for a reservation - [app19] packed!
Loved the food and the [app1] friendly. We wi definitely be going back to Zeta's again. We went for lunch. I had the [app8] shawarma pita and my husband had the gyro. We swapped bites and both were great! They serve pita bread and olive oil at the beginning. It was very good! Definitely homemade pita bread. We were on and out in about 30 minutes over the lunch hour.
I'm not really sure why this place has been poorly rated. I was so impressed with the food, drinks and the patio! I found the service to be a little slow but I like that at times, not feeling rushed [app13] our table over as quickly as possible. The nachos were [app17] and my fish tacos were full of flavour and authentic tasting. The Caesar is one of the best I've ever had! I think the restaurant started off a but slow and rough when they opened which probably led to the poor reviews but trust me when I say this, give it a go! The prices are on point, [app20] has great options and the atmosphere is a perfect summer's night out!
If there is zero star can be chose, I'll go with that one. Went there at 10/20/2013 around 6pm with group of 6. Ordered hummus as appetizer. Main entrees are potato pizza, LOBSTER GNOCCHI, ROASTED CHICKEN and burgers. 3 of us ended up having diarrhea in the middle of the night. Some came with the feeling of puking. 1 of us have acid reflex and lots of gas disturbing the whole night. Other 2 have some gas problem. Don't know what's going on with the food that evening but will [app20] going back again.
There's not much else in Mesa for wine bars and D'Vine has always been a nice refuge when wanting to stay in town. Right around the corner for me and saves driving into Gilbert or Scottsdale. Food has always been tasty and the [app14] friendly each time we've come in. Nice ambiance and the live music has been great so far. Only wish is they'd stay open a little later on the weekends for us night owls. 11PM would be perfect.
If [app0] where to commit a murder I would [app3] not [app4] in. He's [app5] and I'm going to be there for him for better or for worst. Yes he made a big mistake and he should pay for it I know that but i don't think I'll have the heart [app18] in the man I love. We have to protect each other and be their for each other no matter how bad it is. Even if it makes me his accomplice.
I dont think i could [app1] spouse in, or my family and friends if they [app5] a murder because those people are way to close to me and i couldnt picture my life without any of them. Why would anyone send away someone they love, i think that is wong especialy if you live with the person.
Well, this is not an easy question to answer because both are kind of the same to me. But i would have to say [app8] i'd rather have no man in my life than have somebody that isn't concerned about your life at all. To me that kind of is like being fatherless. I can always find another father figure or not even as much as a father figure, more like a male role model.
Raffles founded Singapore and Farquhar was just a subordinate for Raffles. So it was normal that Raffles gave he duty of turning Singapore into a successful city [app9] the city to Farquhar to handle.
They say FF loads faster than IE, but 9 times out of 10, someone [app4] just installed FF will experience slower [app7] load times than loading up IE.
Farquhar was the one [app1] the actual operations, whereas Raffles only came up with the ideas, which would or would not work. Actions require action, and Farquhar implemented those ideas.
people [app0] the choice for themselves. it is not up to us or the government to [app5] add more unwanted children to this world.
Abortion is ok because a fetus isn't a human. To be human, you must have [app5] criteria (IMO)You must be human (homosapien)You must be able to contribute to society.By this criterium, a fetus cannot be considered human, and therefore, abortion is not murder.
me and my wife share an exciting and passionate love life. we love the porn. we pop it on and use it to kick it up a notch. set the room on fire. for us itt is a way to share and [app14] we enjoy together in the bedroom.so as long as it is legal and everyone [app19] age then there should be no problem.
I think common good is better than personal [app2] it's [app3] to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some [app13] needs your help. Yes personal [app16] important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others [app20] to the next level.
In my opinion, i think that advancing the common good is better because when helping others, not only is it appreciated by that [app7] people, but it makes [app9] better as well. It doesn't mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.
Advancing the common [app1] always better [app2] pursuit. If every person decided [app4] the common good, then every person would see the [app8] it. Of course, most people chose personal [app11] they will benefit from it.
I strongly believe that helping yourself is not a selfish thing to do. If everyone took care of themselves and tried to make themselves better [app8] there would be no use of common good. You are the only person that knows what you feel, think and believe if you want change you would do change to yourself.
I think advancing the common [app1] better, because it will eventually [app4] to you anyways. If you better the world somehow, it will also help you out in some way. Whether it is money, fame or just karma.
I believe it is [app1] have a lousy [app3] to have none. It is [app5] have a role model to look up to and without that figure, you might become lost in the world. A lousy father is not that bad because what exactly makes a lousy father, always working and not having time for you. A father that isn't always around is no reason to prefer to have no father. Growing up and seeing the way your father is, makes you want to become [app20] or gives you the [app20] to surpass him and become even better than he is.
Of course India has the POTENTIAL to lead the world, but I don't [app4] happening anytime soon. They have the knowledge, the manpower, and the resources to lead the world.
Honestly, I Think It's better to try a different option besides spanking that can [app4] a child's way of thinking and may get depressed
Honestly, I believe that [app1] shouldn't be accepted to discipline a child. There are many options that parents can take. That's why we have a mouth to speak and say what's right from wrong and wrong from right.
There's some parents that spank their children [app2] little thing. And that is not right. They will always be [app6] of them.
Parents should not rely on spanking their children when they are misbehaving. Although, it may sometimes seem [app5] spank your children, in my opinion it should always be the last resort.
If my spouse [app1] murder I would have [app2] them in, because I don't think I could go on with life [app7] they've murdered someone. The relationship wouldn't be the same it would change because now you view the person as somebody else, you don't see them as your spouse any more, you just see them as a bad person, and they could be [app20] to do something to you.
If [app0] murder someone I [app2] him in , because is a crime and for every act, I have learn that there is a consequence for everything. And he will have to pay for the consequences of [app13] a crime.
I don't care if calling it "marriage" offends people, or violates what they call the sanctity of marriage, gays should have the same RIGHTS that a married couple gets. Civil Union, Marriage, the coming together of two souls, or whatever you [app13] call it- gays NEED to be [app16] on that level. Not allowing this is a violation to the constitution and it's unfortunate that the Supreme Court won't take a case on this because they're leaving it up to the states, yet Bush wanted to make an amendment stating what marriage is...
Religion, lifestyle etc is a personal choice. If your religion or culture disallows gay marriage, that's fine. It means you don't want [app7] a person of the same gender. But then why should it extend [app12] religions or cultures? Gay people marrying in no way affects your marriage to the opposite gender either, they simply get married and get on with it just like you do.
1) It is protected by the first amendment of the Bill of Rights:'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to [app16] Government for a redress of grievances.'-Speech also implies expression2)Desecration of the U.S. flag so far is legal. Although recently (2005) the House passed a law making in illegal to desecrate the American flag. It is still awaiting further approval through our legal system.
There are Scientology schools, where most kids who were born into it go, but I have never heard of it being taught in public school. You wouldn't attend these schools unless you were a Scientologist though, thankfully. Scientology has kind of seeped into many aspects of society by way of a number of front groups that do various things for the community, like Narconon and the like. These groups do not advertise that they are really Scientologists, so it is very possible that if you heard that Scientology [app20] taught in ____ school, it's definitely run by Scientologists.
Yes. I work with a few different local police departments and I trust all of them. As for the city I live in, I do, very much. There are some great [app10] there and they are respectful and caring. They try and do the best they can for the community. The chief is [app17] and backs his officers. We don't have a lot leave from there.
The officer and the business owner have both CLEARLY violated your right to freedom of speech! I would IMMEDIATELY file a [app7] with the U.S. Attorney Generals office, The F.B.I. and your local police cheif, I would also contact every media outlet I could get my hands on with the detailed story. If you have the extra money lying around I would also file a civil suit against [app20] Officer and the business owner. You have clearly been wronged, and don't even think about stepping down. FIGHT BACK. I've won 3 lawsuits against the police in my lifetime already, and I'm only 21 years old. We the people cannot stand for this outright ILLEGAL behavior by law enforcement. If you follow the proper measures, and take this thing to the "top of the hill" that officer will never work behind a badge again, and the business owner will be liable for so many damages to you he'll be put out of business.
Regarding the property, if it's in your home, no one can [app3] without a court order or a criminal complaint alleging it was stolen. Since it is unlikely the gp will falsify a police complaint, I wouldn't worry too much about the property.Generally speaking, the police do not have the right to enter your home or property without a warrant in the majority of cases, Exceptions for responding to call from home and domestic violence.In the matter of the child, you really need to consult with a local attorney. There are too many variables for anyone to give you specific or accurate advice over the Internet.Good luck and hang in there.
If the minor is under 12 yrs old I'd say "NO"But at Twelve I think your pretty aware of the things you are doing and the [app8] them.And there have been a couple of murders in the U.S. that were very thought out, planned. and commited by tweleve and thirteen year olds. I think they should not only be [app20] as an adult But punished as one to.
First, my expertise. I'm a lawyer and I used to work for a firm that did liquor license litigation.It's not entrapment for law [app7] to send minor decoys into a liquor store to see if the [app12] will sell them alcohol. It would only be entrapment if the minor decoy used extraordinary means to convince the [app18] to sell alcohol to him. The test is, was the [app20] predisposed to commit the crime of selling alcohol to minors. If the decoy just says to the clerk, "Oh, come on!" and the [app20] gives in, the [app20] was already predisposed to commit the crime and it's not entrapment.
No. There's a reason that you have to be an adult to serve on a jury. Teens, in general, don't possess the rational and mature thought necessary to make objective decisions based on the evidence, and tend to go more with what their emotions are telling them, which cannot be done in a court case. More life experience and maturity [app20] when making decisions that will affect someones entire life.
As contradictory as this statement may sound, I feel that affirmative action [app4] reverse discrimination but is very necessary in some cases. The biggest problem we are facing today is that the playing field (i.e. in the business world, college admissions, etc.) is not as leveled as some people may think. Sure, Black Americans (as well as other minorities) have come a long way from the old Jim Crow days, but there is a great amount of discrimination that still exists. Believe me, I wish that the policies didn't exist, but then again, that would only occur/work in a perfect, non-discriminatory world...
What is their choice really? Either they do what China tells them or they offer nothing to the people there. There is no way for them to improve conditions for the people of China if the government blocks and removes them? Better to sacrafice and be seen then not sacrafice and be eliminated. People think there is censorship and a lack of privacy here; have no idea what [app20] they enjoy compared to the people of China.
I agree with parts of both of the above answers. It has to do with a childs cognitive development. It [app6] during those years children go from concrete to rational thinking. That is why some subjects are not taught until childrem are older.Some kids on the younger end don't know the difference between right and wrong in many cases. They can have a hard time to know what will happens, or consequence of what they do. Sixteen year olds are cognitely far ahead of a child who is 13 in every respect.
First off, you get what you pay for and secondly, if it seems to good to be true then it probably is. I would bump up to COMP and COLLISION as well in my opinion. I would also ask the agent for a [app14] of the policy itself , called a specimen policy, and comb through it very carefully. It will spell out what you will and won't be getting in the policy. If you are comfortable then yes, go for it. Be advised , anything not covered by the policy in theory could be charged back to you. I work for an insurance company and have seen people lives ruined [app20] having enough or the RIGHT TYPE of insurance. Bad things do happen to good people. I hope this helps.
It seems like it, but NO. No one is above the law. If he is a landlord, report him to the Better Business Bureau, and the city for code violations. If he does have the cops and law [app12] in his pocket (that is shameful!) there is not too much you can do. I would recommend staying away from him if at all possible.A BETTER IDEA: contact your local news agency. Expose him on national TV! They love to expose people like this. It's good for their ratings and it would cause him to stop (hopefully) [app20] least lose his business licence, etc.Edit : My husband says to contact HUD and FBI. You'll need documentation of your claims.
I know this is not true for all religions, there are many, but I'm mainly referring to Christianity and Islam(as they are the ones I know most about). I believe that morals should [app11] trading cards, you can swap them out whenever a better one comes along. I feel that religion keeps people stuck to the views set down in that religious text. I think that without religion people would [app20] more willing to accept new views as they come along. E.g. Catholicism and contraception or homosexuality. People basing their moral views on thousand year old texts seems obscured to me. I am [app20] that there is room for interpretation but I think the world would be a better place if people made there own moral decisions instead of being prescribe them by their religion. I am not against religion I just think your religion should not control your morality CMV. Thanks. _____
To keep this a narrowly focused conversation I ask that colleges in large cities be excluded from this discussion. While many universities in major urban areas can provide a similar experience to a "college town" considering this factor [app12] topic too broad for productive discussion. __________________________________________________________Much like public school, college serves to teach social skills as much as work related skills. Living around a large number of people your age helps you build important social skills and promotes self discovery and development. Forced interaction in environments like dorms, fraternities and sororities is an experience that builds self confidence, self reliance, and valuable experience living independent from parents with people of a similar age. Going to a community college or 4 year university with very few students living near/on campus aka commuter campus provides an inferior social education. As such graduates, on average, will be less socially [app20] than those who went a more traditional 4 year university.
If there was high unemployment in a country, like there is today in most western countries, why would their need to be an influx of more cheap labor? Swelling the ranks of labor when the labor market doesn't grow just creates more [app14] for fewer jobs, incentivizing employers to hire the employee they can pay the least. Forcing the unemployed and low skilled workers to compete with cheap immigrant labor depresses wages for the lower class. Using skilled immigrant labor for construction, IT, manufacturing, etc. depresses wages for the middle class, which [app20] the lower class. There is no need to bring in more labor, and it is done by business with the intent to keep labor cheap. Cheap labor benefits the employer much more than the employee or the consumer, who can afford to spend less on depressed wages. CMV
If the government seeks to deprive me of the means (like a gun) to defend myself against people who seek to harm me or my property, then the burden of responsibility to protect me falls on the government.To me, what that means is that the government should be readily available to give me an equal chance of protection as if I myself had a gun to neutralize any threats (like armed intruders). Realistically, this means that police need to show up within 10-20 seconds if there is an armed intruder in my home. I think that is enough time for me to survive (via running or hiding) as an unarmed person facing off against an armed intruder.If someone is in [app20] or killed in a situation where they could have defended themselves if they had a gun, but were unable to do so because the government deprived them of the means to defend themselves, then I think the government shares some part of the blame for allowing that situation to happen.
The usual con-argument is that anything that can be invented needs to come from previous knowledge. Knowledge [app5] collective (laws of physics, [app7] discoveries/inventions), meaning that the result of applying such knowledge should also belong to mankind as a whole. However, I believe that innovation, or the ability to use this knowledge for an entirely new purpose, is a private effort and should be protected as such. Individuals should be allowed to use their time and talent for economic purposes, in which case intellectual property laws are fundamental. I also believe that abolishing intellectual property could result prejudicial to [app20] progress as less people would be willing to dedicate their lives to innovating.
I think the killing of the palestinians in Isreal is [app3] shapes of genocide.By simply looking at the numbers of casualties on both sides, the casualties on the side of the palistinians massively outnumber the ones on the Isrealian side.They don't seem to care if the people they kill are Hamas, it starts to look like they kill purely based on one criterium and that is if the person is from palistina.If Hamas is using their own people as human shield like they say, it doesn't justify just wrecklessly kill them.CMV
If I understand my history correctly, the idea of a 12 hour clock is basically a relic from a time before we had better ways of measuring and keeping track of time.I don't see any benefit in continuing to use this system. However, if 24-hour time became the standard, there could only be positives. It makes more sense numerically, since there's no need for a modifier like "am". It should make mental calculations concerning time simpler. It also makes things less confusing for the average person (no accidentally [app20] your alarm for 7:00PM.)From what I can gather, the only reason we still use 12-hr clocks is because of tradition and/or refusal to change.
We see naked animals all the time, and that sex is how most animals procreate is common scientific knowledge. Most people survive encountering naked animals, or even animals having sex with little to no issues. People are basically high functioning animals, and the existence of nude beaches/nudist colonies and swingers clubs/porn shoots is proof that nudity/sex in front of other people is not a danger or harms the non-participating [app20] in any way. Since there is no harm, there should be no laws regulating how we choose to clothe ourselves or where we engage in consenting activities, so long as we are legally allowed to be there (i.e. This does not [app20] to another persons private property, where they would have final say). CMV.
If you were rich you could live at whatever standard you chose, you could go on vacation, you could feed your interests and hobbies, and live whatever [app9] wanted.If that didn't do it for you, you could give a bunch of money to the poor and people would like you anyway.If you still felt insecure about things you could hire a coach and stuff so you wouldn't be, and your friends around you [app20] better, [app20] you used that money for a good cause
As a brief intro to this debate, this is not only a debate of the question presented, but of the philosophies behind it. So, for those who don't know much philosophy, just argue about the question. For those of us who know much about philosophy, there will [app15] a debate within the debate.I will be arguing that we should kill the one person.My first regular argument is that even if you don't intentionally [app20] other people die, by letting them die (not killing the one person) you are still effectively killing them. If you see someone drowning in a lake, and you just watch and laugh, you have effectively just killed them.My first philosophical argument is that deontology contradicts itself [app20] respecting human worth. It says everyone has infinite worth, yet we are not respecting the worth of each of the many people if we let them die.
---Could we [app0] to take the place of IE---Opera is great. It has all the best features of the browsers, but it has the leastrecognition. Take "Speed dial" for example. It puts your 9 most used bookmarks in thescreen when you create a blank tab. It also has many add ons, but it's community isjust beginning. Also, it was recentlly rated very highly in CPU magazine, with itsonly flaw being it's lack of add ons, which is greatly increasing. Opera will bereleasing a new [app20] of the browser; 9.52, which will have many enhancements,including speedier performance than any of it's competitors. In fact, Opera is sogood that until recently, people were willing to pay for it.
I don't know this story, I'm not familiar with the details. I don't know what constituted the slap, how heavy the slap was or to what part of the body. There's a lot of information here I am missing. But I truly do believe that [app15] one's back on a hostile situation like that and note that it is the domain of policing or child protective services deprives us a little bit of our humanity. I'm not saying that every intervention needs to be violent or threatening in nature, but I believe that sometimes it is worthwhile and [app20] act, even if it means you may subject yourself to serious legal consequences. This is what compels us to stop when we see an accident and offer assistance.If it was me. I'd like to think I would have intervened. Who can say unless you're in the situation, though.
We have to accept that for a 20 year span starting in about 1985 or so, steroids were prevalent in Major League Baseball. Will some of baseball's records be broken and changed because of this? Probably. But so what. The Hall of Fame is, in effect, a museum that chronicles the history or baseball, good and bad. To omit someone from the Hall of Fame because of 'suspected' steroid use is ridiculous. It is crazy to let [app20] into the Hall because we 'don't think' they took steroids, but prevent someone else from entering because "we think" they did.
Surprisingly good! Not sure why so many negative reviews for this place but that certainly wasn't our experience. We arrived around 8:30pm and were seated immediately. The place filled up over the next 15-20 minutes but our [app12] remained efficient, [app13] and helpful. We [app14] 2-for-$35 bbq platter and it was awesome! Ribs, chicken, pulled pork, tri tip, a hot link and an assortment of sides. The tri tip, ribs and chicken were excellent and I never even got around to the pulled pork. Honestly, better bbq than any place we have back home.Beverages are pretty pricey but for $8.50 ($5 more than the regular fountain drink) you can get a fountain drink in a cool souvenir glass to take home that would cost you $7.50 by itself in their store.All in all, I was more than pleased by both the [app20] the atmosphere.
Met all our expectations! I've watched Gordon Ramsay's YouTube video on how to make Beef Wellington several times because it is such an amazing dish and work of art! I've never tasted it or attempted to make it, so coming here was a dream came true. We [app15] dinner special to share: Caesar salad, Beef Wellington, bread pudding for dessert with a side of Mac n cheese. Everything was fantastic. We were so full we took most of the Mac n cheese home. If I were to describe Beef Wellington to someone else who has never tasted it I'd say it's the most tender [app20] you've ever had. It seams to me that the flakey shell around the [app20] steams it while it cooks so [app20] longer [app20] like a steak, but more like a roast. It's very delicious, just not what I expected.Now that I know what Beef Wellington [app20] like from the master himself, I can attempt a homemade [app20] for the holidays with his YouTube guidance!
No. I couldn't imagine turning on my spouse like that. I know if i were to do something like that she will be right there [app8] me [app9] a word. Plus if she were to kill someone it would be for a good reason.
Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have from him are his absence, and not knowing what he was like. A lousy father could come in gain your trust, and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. To me having a [app18] does nothing is in itself an absence because either way he knows [app20] you, and you nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in [app20] of my life.
I think it would be better fatherless the reason why is because i have never had a father in my life. I think that if you have a lousy father you will be taught to be lousy just like him. Parents are supposed to be [app15] for their kids, not just be lazy and that type of thing. Whats the point of having a bum for a father your whole life? you are not going to learn anything from him so why keep him? I feel like a mother can raise a son the same as a father can, well at least my mother did.
No.If you research about FarQuhar.He didn't do anything to help Singapore while Raffles was away,instead of doing anything [app6] made a big mess [app8] things like vice,crimes and gambling dens carry on.
Farquhar [app0] his men to go to Malacca and bring some food back. The traders in Singapore also brought some of the necessities here.
If pornography and the people who produce it were well respected by society, then no argument could be made that porn was degrading anyone.Likewise, if, as a society we were to berate movie actors (for example), then the act of being an actor would become degrading.It isn't [app15] of [app16] the porn that needs to change, but rather the acceptance of it in society.
I think that advancing the common [app2] better [app3] pursuit. The reason for this is that it is better to help others than just to think about yourself. We need to improve our community first before we think about ourselves. If everyone tried to take care of their community then there would be no dangerous places.
I Believe that its [app1] have a lously father [app3] father; because growing up being fatherless would have a major impact on your childhood.Meaning, wondering about who your father was and what he was lousy at or good at. Also growing up without a lously father would mean you cant prove to your father that there is greatness in him; meaning the son he made turns out to become a bright [app20] person in society.
I have been spanked once in a while for worse deeds. I think it did more good than harm to be honest. It's like touching fire to be honest, but a lot of [app11] on parents and kids. It may do its job it may not, but abuse is never good.
Spanking should never be the answer. Spanking should be the LAST option.Yes, I agree that if [app5] to a certain point you can lightly spank the kid, but never to the point where you're beating the kid.
Nope. I believe it shouldnt be done just to discipline a child. Parents could just scold [app5] they would stop what they are doing wrong. Hitting is not really a solution because aside hurting a child emotionally, it also hurts them physically. Kids [app15] learn [app16] of respect for their parents because they would only learn how to be scared. They wont do the wrong action again next time, [app20] they've learned their lesson, but because they are just [app20] that their parents would hit them
I would [app0] if they [app2] murder. I would not want my wife [app5] on me and kill me. If I found out that she had killed someone I would be gone. You can't love a person if they are not the person that you fell [app16] with. And I wouldn't fall [app19] with a murderer.
Im all about the no snitching saying but when it comes to murder thats when [app5] is drawn. Yea at first I probably wouldn't do anything about it. Then I think about there is few reasons why [app12] be drove to kill but I don't think [app16] should be committed. In saying that i would [app19] wife [app20] she ever killed somebody.
They are treated differently because attemepted murder and an officer involved shooting are completely different things. If a citizen, as you put it, "commits attempted murder", he goes to jail when the investigation has been completed and probable cause has been found. Also, he does get bail for an attempted murder charge. People also get bail in murder charges, so I'm not really sure [app20] are going with that.If an officer gets in a shooting on-duty, he/she was probably faced with a direct threat to his/her life or a victim's life. Even if justified, the shooting will be investigated to make sure all laws and policies were followed.It seems you want to [app20] the police before all of the facts are investigated. Remember, innocent unitl proven guilty.
Most people are required to enlist the [app2] of a financial advisor. This is a very good thing as it allows you to [app7] the money, instead of letting it sit in your [app11] account.If this is court awared inheritance, then the court will most likely require a financial advisor.Aside from the investing, what the person whants to do with the money is up to them. There really isn't any other steps to worry about.You don't need to tell the government, you don't need to include it on your taxes unless you want to, and frankly, other than investing, there isn't much more for you to do, aside from get the check, cash it, invest it, and live.Don't go overboard, and spend all the money at one time, mind you. Spend well, and leverage your money the best you can.
If he doesn't already have a competent attorney, you need to hire one immediately.These types of cases can be especially complicated, as there is more at stake than you may realize. For instance, a conviction on a drug charge may mean reduce or little eligibility for federal student [app16] in college, (if he decides to go that route). Although it IS against the [app20] give anyone a drug that is not prescribed for him, there is always grounds to review this with the prosecuting authority.I urge you to contact a skilled criminal defense attorney in your area. Be prepared to pay a sizeable retainer. For a referral to a criminal defense attorney, contact your local or state bar association.
He is doing exactly as he should. These cases can cost a firm a fortune to pursue and he needs to make sure that taking this case on is a good financial decision, meaning that not only is it a good case that they can reasonably expect to win on but also that the recovery involved will be sufficient [app19] the time and expense involved in taking it on.He can't do that without an informed opinion on the facts involved.What more are you expecting him to tell you? He will either agree to represent you or decline based [app20] others opinion weighed against his risk factors. And even if he declines to represent you, it doesn't [app20] mean that your case isn't worth pursuing in general. It just [app20] it isn't worth it to him. If he feels you have no case period, he will tell you that also.
Depends. Both are given due to obvious and extreme criminal offenses. But then, I would really agree with you that death penalty is something that should be abolished. I dont know, I am not talking from the legal point of view, but on a moral level that no one has a right to take another persons life, if crime is [app20] the punishment should be ''corrective'' and something where [app20] should go through repent. Entire life in jail, made to rot in jail, or made to work, is better than putting someone to death.
Disagree. Firstly, it is the people of Singapore - not outsiders - who should make that decision.Secondly, low crime rates in Singapore are directly attributable to their non-tolerance of those who seek to undermine society. Singapore is a society which tolerates all cultures and religions and welcomes their diversity - but it will not pander to a minority who seek to destroy the society they have created.However, the death penalty in itself is not the reason for the high quality of life in Singapore. It is merely one component of a society which believes that protecting the innocent is more important than protecting the guilty.Incidentally, the previous writer's argument that the death penalty is 'more expensive' than life in prison is only true in the USA, which has an incredibly complex appeals process that leads to legal manouvering rather than true justice.
The Church has a tendency to exonerate itself when ever it sees fit on what ever the matter might be. I don't see where this would be no different. The idea that the church is NOT flawed and IS the body of Christ is something that it has been trying to hold to the highest degree since its conception. If it shows flaw. Misjudgment, mismanagement, what ever the case might be, can it see itself as the body of Christ with all its imperfections? So to answer the question yes I [app20] does exonerate itself.
It certainly can if you have the right attorney. Racial remarks are a form of sexual harrassment and the company, along with the person, and the supervisor can be held liable for it. The USA has laws in place that prohibits anyone from having to work in a hostile work environment. The first step you need to take is to contact the human resource (or personnel) [app20] of your workplace and tell them your story. You need to write down what was said, the date it was said if you remember, and who was, if anyone, a witness when the person said it. If the human resource [app20] does not do anything about this, go above their head and contact the main office. If this option is not available to you, I would consult [app20] attorney to determine what the next step is you should take. Be sure to have with you a [app20] of the complaint, if one was given to you, to take to the attorney.
It all depends on the crime. For the most part i [app3] your grown enough to go and do an adult crime then you need to do the adult time. If we continue to [app11] youth get away with serious crimes then older crimebodies will continue to get our youth in trouble. We must raise our children correctly so they want end up in some prison but there are certain [app20] is morally wrong no matter if your [app20] or 35 and those are the crimes our young "adult" should be charged for.
If you have a lawyer, notify him or her right away. If you don't have a lawyer, get one.You should contact the court to determine if a hearing is actually set for Friday. Even though you might not have been served with papers, it would not be a good idea to ignore this situation as others have suggested. For you all you, your ex might have gotten someone to falsify a proof of service to show that you were properly served. You might have to request a continuance and [app20] prepare for the hearing. If there is a hearing and you don't show up, the court might make and adverse ruling against you that could be difficult to undo.
Youtube is a big video website that hosts many videos. Twitch is a streaming website where you mostly watch someone playing a game.If Youtube were to take over Twitch, they would help a lot with the servers and so Twitch would run faster. This is just my speculation though.Also, Youtubers could get help with streaming and this would help promote their channel.Youtube could [app20] then catering to a wider audience, thus making Youtube bigger.In the past, I've been against some of the things that's happened to Youtube, such as the Google+ integration. But I can't really see many downsides to them taking over Twitch.Just to note, I do understand that Google own Youtube.I'm an avid Youtube user, watching several videos throughout the day, and uploading my own content. So if there are any downsides, I want to know about them and put things in [app20] try and stop them happening to me.
In the UK every few years the government's 'cabinet' has a reshuffle and the minister in charge of, for example, education moves job to become minister in charge of transport.Surely it would be more sensible if every few years elections were held where academic experts in each relevant [app16] (each nominated by one party) competed for the position?The current system where a career politician can go from being a local MP, to being in charge of the entire Education system then suddenly switch jobs and be in charge of the nations Healthcare the next week makes absolutely no [app20] me - CMV.edit: By academic I meant something along the lines of 'A recognised subject matter expert with relevant experience' rather than implying only university professors could hold office.
Basically I think that the public has a right to know about stabbings, robbery, etc. but should not disclose the name(s) of the perpetrators to the general public unless it's a matter of security (the criminal is currently at large or imprisoned.) I personally feel [app15] announcing the names of the perpetrators involved in a murder/suicide case only makes it so other criminals commit similar crimes for media attention. That being said I don't feel that the events should be covered up, but that the specific names of criminals involved should be kept from the public. CMV.
I'm a really young male (19) but I am seriously considering having a rhinoplasty, chin , jaw and cheek augmentation. I would never say that I'm ugly but I am pretty average. I think that once I get the procedures done I will become dramatically more attractive/handsome more girls will check me and that would boost my confidence to approach them, or even make them approach me. I also believe that having a really attractive face(and a strong body which I'm gonna build) will help me get into male modeling, something that is really interesting and gives you the opportunity to meet new people and travel more.There you go , change my view !
I've been to 4 methods of schooling. The problem with all of them is that they base on memorization instead understanding the concept of what is being taught. I have honestly learned more from reading.I think the education should be improved where students can pick their classes. Though, I understand, some classes are needed. But, others aren't. Schools should not use the same routine for every student. Some students will never be good at certain subjects and never wish to be. For them, schools should take those classes out of the schedule (depending on the class), and replace it with something they plan on having a career in.Also, Economics should be in the prime schedule. Many house foreclosures come from people who know little in the world of [app20] and rely on other people to manage their money.
The impeachment of a president at this state in our nation's history would be disastrous, and catastrophic. All of those who believe president Obama is such an awful president must not realize he is not the one who originally put us into such a sorry economic state, if he does continue improving the economy it [app18] we can set ourselves back on the correct track.
I believe that euthanasia should be available to those who would like it. Euthanasia offers a painfree way to allow the patient to leave this earth on a happy note, [app10] the person and their families. Euthanasia can be a way that people in huge amounts of pain could go to and be put out of their pain instead of waking up each and every morning hping that tomorrow you won't. Euthanasia provides everyone with a safe and simple solution to end the human suffering.
I would rather be deaf because they can practically cure deafness with a pretty [app4] device. I'm not sure what the device or procedure is called, but what you wear a device on the outside of your ear that picks up sound. That device sends this sound to a device that is inserted into your brain, and through a series of nuerons, impulses, and electrical thingies "scientific term", you can hear. It's not exact, and it takes months for your brain to "learn" sound, but a lot of deaf people are having these surgeries.They are working on something similiar for eyes, but it is much more complicated, as the eye has so many nerve endings/connections.
Yes....I [app0] is a little much. On top of the religious aspect, I think we shouldn't have it sung in schools period.School is meant to be an objective learning atmosphere. Introducing peer-reinforced (bandwagon effect due to surrounding peers) patriotism and religious bias has no place in an environment meant to accomodate students of all backgrounds and religions. To me, looking back at my early school days, it seems a little like indoctrination.So I support at the very least removing religious references in order to accomodate all religous beliefs.The only way to do that is to have a secular PoA (I don't support any athiestic references either btw :P) .Further, I think Issues of patriotism should be left to students and their parents outside of school.
This marks the [app1] I've EVER given a five-star review to any form of chain restaurant, but it's well-warranted here. I've visited this location four times since it opened, and even at the height of the "NEW FOOD! EVERYBODY EAT THERE!" furor, the [app14] was unfailingly polite and cheerful, the chicken was [app17] and well-cooked, the biscuits were perfect and the dirty rice was great. I've even tried the Cajun tenders, and unlike most places where any form of boneless chicken has as much seasoning as the [app20] in which it is delivered, the tenders here have some real kick. Make sure you get the "mild" ones for the kiddos.I'm taking lunch to my son at school on Friday, and pondering picking up a big box o'bird to share with the teachers ...
One of the most disgusting restaurants I've ever eaten at. I was on a business trip in Phoenix on decided to stop in for some Mexican food. The place was bad news from the very beginning.The hostess was super unfriendly and looked as if she couldn't wait to get home. When I sat down at the table, a couple of bugs fell [app20] from the lamp shade overhead-- I should have gotten up then.The chips were greasy, margaritas straight sugar w/ very little liquor and the enchiladas bland as can be. In [app20] this, I got food poisoning and was up all night running to the bathroom.You couldn't pay me to go back to this restaurant. It should be closed down immediately for its lack of cleanliness and poorly prepared food.
My husband and I came to celebrate his new position. We had impeccable [app4] and our food [app5] also. I had the Steak Diane and Salmon combo, while [app9] enjoyed the shrimp and chicken alfredo. I chose to write this review because we also witnessed the [app16] accommodating a woman with a visual impairment. Her waitress literally read her the majority of [app20] until she found something she wanted. Her waitress was patient and attentive.
Awesome pizza!!! We ordered margherita and diavola pizza and both were spectacular. We have been to Naples and had pizza there and the pizza at Inizio is the closest we have been able to find in the US. The sauce is delicious!!! The restaurant is really well decorated and has a great atmosphere and we loved the tables. The [app19] was also super friendly. Loved every bit of it; we will definitely be back!
Another reason [app0] against school uniforms is that they deprive the children of their individuality. The stress on a uniform dress code in school opposes the spirit of unity in diversity and its celebration. It is even claimed to restrict socialization, a vital aspect of human nature.
in my own personal opinion i think [app2] uniforms are not a good idea. adults are always telling us to be our selfes and to express who we really are. but we cant do that while wearing a stupid uniform to school!!
Mozilla Firefox is better than Internet Explorer because it alerts you that it has blocked pop-ups and automatically updates the older [app7] to the latest [app8] along with a google toolbar and it downloads very quickly
Television is almost the [app1] thing as books, the only difference is, you actually have [app5] your eyes for books
I think it's better to be [app2] having someone to look up to, I'd rather choose [app5] than having a uncaring and lousy father [app8] be a stain in my life. I wouldn't look up [app12] and he doesn't [app14] have to be the fatherly figure I have to look up to.
I would rather be "fatherless" then having a "lousy father", because a "father" is supposed to be the man of [app6] and set a good example so the rest of the family can look up to him. So if I look up at a lousy father I might then be a lousy person, but if I had [app19] then I'll set the standards for my own self and step up and be the man of [app20] I had younger brothers or sisters.
I think in any case its [app2] have [app3] then to have a lousy father either way you still lose. When you have a [app8] to be the best he can be so you can learn from him as you grow up. If you were to have a lousy father then whats the point of having a [app20] all if he's just going to be [app20] he wouldn't teach you anything. It's [app20] to have a respectable father figure in your life then to have a lousy father figure.
Coming from a casual internet user, I prefer IE because it has a sleeker design, and I find the bookmark/history thing easier. I'm using firefox though, cuz I don't want to transfer my bookmarks again after [app12] made [app13] default browser.
Without William Farquhar Singapore would have perished. Only because William was [app3] govern the country, Singapore continued to exist. Raffles [app7] govern another country.
I think that such a [app1] a good idea. Uniforms [app3] equal on an economic level This can be prevent envy and jealousy.
I believe its [app1] have a lousy father than to be fatherless. I myself know what's its like to not have a father, so to me it would be better to have a lousy father [app12] all. For some people, to have a lousy father is like having no father. But in reality you don't really know how good your father is or how good you really have it until he is gone and never coming back.
Yes. India does have the potential to lead the world. If the Indian [app4] look after a country with 28 states of 28 ways, culture, geographical and language, it can certainly can lead the world. For example, there is heavy rainfall in Manipur , while there is water scarcity in Rajasthan. It also has the most wonderful technological developments. Economically also India isn't that low. Eg: Chandrayaan from India discovered water on Moon. What do u say about that? And the father of astronomy, aryabhatta was from India.
I think [app0] use spanking as an [app2] but there is also a limit for everything so they shouldn't use it every time the kids do something wrong.
It is unnecessary, as well as being quite unrelated to how a child develops into an adult. There are children who were spanked [app7] who grow up to be terrible adults, and children who were not spanked growing up who become good or even great adults.
Yes, if the person I loved and lived with murdered someone then I would definitely [app5] in. Murder is premeditated and intentional so you never know if later on down [app10] they [app11] on you.
I would say that [app1] I would [app2] husband in because a murderer is not who I wanted to marry. And also, if [app8] killed someone else, who knows if his next attack will be on me. Obviously he is messed up in the head if he [app16] murder and thats not who I want to spend the rest of my life with.
P.E. should be optional in [app1] grade. If students want to participate, then so be it. However, in [app6] grade students have a lot going on. That time may be used more beneficially by studying.
i'm not pleased with the idea to increase P.E. requirement. First, i thinks that it is not up to the college to require students to exercise. i believes that students have the responsible to choose whether or not to work out. Also, i says that there shouldn't be any P.E. requirement in the college. According to me, the college is a [app20] train our brain not our body. i adds that if students do need exercise, they can exercise on their own as me. i goes hiking and plays basketball in my neighborhood.
Personal [app0] better because its easier to [app2] then it is to help others. Plus not [app6] want to be helped. A persons' need is more important then others need, you need to your personal pursuits first. In this world you have to fight for what you want.
Look, this is what you need to do! Try and get the money.The hospital bills can be paid in full by the hospitals billing department, all you need to do is put a statement in writing stating you can not pay [app13] and most hospitals have to clear the account. Thats most hospitals,,,not all will. But its worth it.If you have no means to pay for it, then you dont.My father just passed away and he had not a potty to even use,and I thought once I went to the showing they would try and get me..well they didnt, cause most states (if u look into it more) will grant you so much to lay them in the ground. My state here in Ohio gave my father $6000.00 for his..they have to do something with the funds for tax write off reasons. So call Leagle Aide in your state and see what they tell you.
Yes if you feel he is doing more damage than good by being involved in her life, you have the right to ask for sole custody. This can be hard to prove, [app10] there has never being a court order in place as far as visitation. My opinion, the judge would order specific days for visitation first. If he did not follow the visitation dates, the judge will assume that is basically giving up his parental rights and could order you sole custody. Again, this may take some time.As for child support, definitely. He will be subject to back child support from the day she was born unless he can prove that he was paying.You would do both of these by going to your county child support services office and filing child support payment/custody documents. Not hard to fill out and they will assist you in doing them. The more information you have about your daughters dad the better i.e. job information, social security, drivers license, address, etc.
yes!!! the effects from "weed" are far less than the [app3] alcohol, if it was legal it would free alot of space in our prisons, where they are placed for a non-violent crime, and i believe it would cause alot less people to use harder drugs! and people who need it for medical reasons wouldn't have to go thru all the garbage they need to now for relief!!!
No. God never specified that looking at a naked woman was against his laws. However, in Matthew, Jesus states (in relation to adultery) that if you lust after a woman in your thoughts, then you are just as guilty as if you have sex with her. You can lust after a woman with her clothes [app18] off, but any male (that's honest) will tell you that it is [app20] to lust over a naked woman than a clothed woman.So no, it's not against God's law, but it's not a very good idea. Like taking an alcoholic to a bar, it's just better to stay away from that kind of temptation.
Wow that had to hurt you alot. i Cannot imagine the thought that you were holding back someone you loved. BUT i do not think you are. If hes not worried i wouldn't either. Sounds like his boss needs to get with he times and realize that gays, interracial couples, lesbians and most relationships are common place. I am sure if he keeps pushing your boyfriend that he will make a [app20] find another firm rather than loose you. Good luck
The only problem with this form of punishment is it does nothing to remove the mental drive of the perpetrator. He will still have the same thoughts. Maybe a combination, frontal lobotomy and castration, will do the trick, but I can't see any State passing this into law. I'm more in favor of the two strikes and your shot approach. Besides, bullets are so much cheaper than surgery.
Wow, that's tough. Is your assignment to argue that retribution is socially cohesive, or did you come up with this yourself?This is what I can think of:Retributive justice is based on the idea that criminals should be punished for undermining social "harmony" or "balance." Therefore, we can't dole out retributive punishment before we first have a definition of what is social harmony or balance. Social harmony and balance can be defined through laws, custom, or religion. The PROCESS of defining social harmony and balance is socailly cohesive because, to some extent, we must generally agree on what the definition of social order is. In other words, the PROCESS of [app20] and agreeing on laws/customs/religion is socially cohesive.The rehabilitation theory of punishment is probably the most socially cohesive because it is based on rehabiliting [app20] so that he can successfully reenter society.
Well, here are a few ways:1. Don't cover his hate-mongering on the [app4] news. The whole reason that "church" keeps going is because they get publicity. Complain to TV stations that cover them.2. If you are at a funeral or [app13] where they are present, either tell them how much their actions hurt and offend you, or stand in front of them with your backs to them. You have the right to do this from the 1st amendment, just like they do.3. Support organizations, such as PFLAG, who work against discrimination, bigotry and homophobia. Support the same causes yourself.I tried to limit my answer to things an individual can do, vs. staging a counterdemonstration and other [app20] require lots of people and money.Thanks for your thoughtful question.
i believe in certain situations it would be permissable. for example, if what somebody is doing affects another [app6] group in a negative way then the government should be allowed to step in. the government works for us as a whole, not each individual person. we are allowed certain [app16] and to do most things the way we want to but there are limits on everything. if protecting society by limiting one person's freedoms is the best plan of action then the government should have every right to do so
I'm having trouble finding anything positive about this decade. Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful that I have [app6] shelter and a good job, but I find that there isn't a lot to look positively on. For example, everyone is always buried in their smartphone. I can't even enjoy myself when I go to a concert because everyone has their phone in the air to film the show. They've ruined every social situation I can think of.Something else I've noticed is that a lot of people have started to become more [app20] of more and more people. (eg, the LBGT community) The thing is though, it seems like it's more of a fad to like it instead of actually [app20] them. I know, I'm probably a monster for thinking that way, but it's how I feel...
In a practical sense, our basic needs are pretty much nutrients and water. Everything is society, such as wealth, income, education, and [app7] just [app8] make our lives appear meaningful. They don't exist in the physical world. Hunter and gatherers don't need these social hierarchies to find meaning in their existence. Okay, they may have shorter life expectancy. So what? There's no philosophical explanation on why life has to be long. The fact is that we, civilians, have to create allusion to make our lives content.
I watched the Spider-Man [app1] (Toby Maguire) probably sound the age of 6 the [app4] and saw absolutely nothing wrong with them. Watching again 10 years later I though maybe at times Toby could seem a little bit mopey but I don't understand why there is so much aggression toward the actor. He was decent in the great Gatsby. Am I missing something here? Poeple on internet constantly complain about his various faces. I have only notice the one mildly aggravating mopey face. Please elaborate as much as you can on this subject please and thank you.
Let's start with the numbers:Arizona Iced Tea (lemon): [app2] grams of sugar in 8 oz.Coca-Cola Classic: 27 gPepsi: 28 gIngredients:Arizona: tea brewed in filtered water, high fructose corn syrup, citric acid, lemon flavor.Coke: carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup, caramel color, phosphoric acid, flavors, caffeine.Their first two ingredients are basically identical: water and high fructose corn syrup. Of course, Arizona gets its flavor mostly from tea leaves while Coke gets it from flavoring. They both stain teeth; Coke has caramel color while Arizona again gets it from the tea leaves.I like both drinks, but I feel at this point that they are both pretty terrible at this point and that they should only be used sparingly. CMV.
I've read that America spends three times as much on Special Education students than on normal students in the classroom. I find it puzzling how Special Education students (at least in New York) get [app11] two teachers that personally teach them, and tons of new high tech equipment in their classrooms. However, many of the needier schools lack even a laptop cart, while Special Education students each have individual tablets. I believe that the Special Education system needs serious reforming, but if [app20] refute this argument, I'm open to thinking differently.
It's not that our generation puts money over people, its just that our generation has learned from its past that people aren't forever. People die, people leave, people change and most importantly, people can't always be there for you - point blank. And when this happens, all you have is YOURSELF &amp; your [app17] and your hobbies and your interests to keep you going. The thing is, [app20] hobbies and interests have a cost nowadays. $. You better be making enough to do what you enjoy most.Cause being lonely and broke is worse [app20] lonely but making enough to see the [app20] you want to see and [app20] trips you want to take. You have to make enough to keep your own life going so you won't stay stuck in the past.
Although I believe both [app1] and football are both deeply rooted in America's history, I believe that [app5] has to America's number one pastime. It's the popularity of [app9] in the days of Babe Ruth that all sports strive to achieve. It is with that type of popularity or attention to one specific thing that brings people together. Baseball definitely has to be America's favorite pastime, well at least it is my book.
I dunno... the open platform seems extremely weird. Game producer's will, of course, have a [app5] time developing games but I don't see the point to buying one [app9] and then having an "Xbox", "Playstation", and "Nintendo" station for it... the only reason those names exist is because they make their own consoles. The three big competitors in this industry would be strapped to one box... making money off of their interfaces? Compared to third-party producers, the three companies [app20] games so it seems like there would be a substantial loss of profit for the giants.I want to see the competition, [app20] is what keeps the hardware advancing and taking everything to next-gen.
The [app0] of the Engineering process category in SPICE are more beneficial for designing or assessing processes of typical projects developing software-intensive systems. SPICE shows the relation of tests to requirements and integration tests to architecture and design much clearer than CMMI. Additionally, SPICE contains a sophisticated list of typical input and output work products with detailed characteristics that greatly supports process development work. CMMI is missing such a systematic approach regarding work products.
I loathe Vegas but can't avoid it for work. It's restaurants like Mesa that make it bearable for me. Not a celebrity chef-chaser, but chose this because of other reviews and Flay's reputation. It did NOT disappoint. Duck starter made me swoon. Wow. Spicy. Queso fundido was great. Tuna entree was amazing. Service was top notch and authentic. This is a pricy place but well [app20] investment.
We are staying at Paris hotel the first morning we had our [app4] here the food [app5] good and the guy that served us was friendly and helpful so the following morning we did not hesitate eating [app12] here again. unfortunately, the waiter assigned to us was not friendly and helpful at all! They have dish that are not on [app20] this guy mumbles those dish that are unfathomable, gave us a lukewarm coffee [app20] he served the food no follow up if we need anything, i have to ask a coffee refill from the guy clearing the other table. The food was good but the second waiter we had was a total let down .
My coworkers kept on raving about this place so I had to go check it out. Maybe my tastes are just different, but I was not all that impressed. Apparently the place has won awards for it's Thanksgiving themed turkey sandwich, which I got, but I found the sandwich to be passable - nothing spectacular. Food was decent, [app19] so-so, and I think everything was a tad overpriced.I mean if you're tired of the normal chains like Subway, Quizno's, etc... going to a "mom and pop" shop like this one may break the monotony, but this one is actually a chain too...
One of the worse dining experiences I have ever had! Our food order was lost somehow and after 2 hours, we finally received our food. Management [app8] accommodating and comped our meals, only [app11] around and say that the gift cards I was using would not allow them to use the last 10.00 on each of them, and they needed another 30.00, unknown to us was the fact that they had already taken all of the money off the gift cards. So they actually stole 30.00 from us. No way to prove it, but be careful if you use a gift card. I will be letting all of my friends know about this!
I like fried fish so gave it a try. Don't bother. It is a cheap meal for sure but not good. Think frozen fish square on a bun. I got the deluxe which [app11] mayo lettuce and tomato. No tarter which is incredibly stupid as it may have salvaged the bland sandwich. Especially since they barely put on any mayo. Won't be back.
I have always maintained that it is a good [app3] wear a uniform to school. Why not? because it looks very nice and respectful. This shows [app9] of schools and students. I always liked to wear a uniform at my school, I felt like a schoolgirl, and brought up.
No I would not [app1] in, because it would be to weird for me [app5] them in to the police. I [app7] wouldn't tell anybody. I would hope that the police catch them but I would not say anything. I would tell them [app15] their self in.
I rather be [app1] having a lousy father because of this is that I wouldn't want to know how lousy he is and how bad he [app9] being a father. Being alone with just a mother is fine with me. It's just how I am. I wouldn't want to have a alcohlic [app18] drinks on the couch all day and curses my mother. It's just plain and simple, I have a good father or don't have a [app20] all even though he his still in the house, I wouldn't call him my [app20] all.
Raffles came [app0] Singapore, returning after a long period of time. Farquar [app4] here all the time, and solved many problems. Raffles did not do much at all compared to Farquar.
William made the initiative to understand the locals and [app3] with them. He even learnt Malay [app5] to make conversation easier.
Benefiting yourself is always an assessable task but having a chance [app3] the common good only comes around once in a life time. You have to take into consideration that you can improve the lives or situations of the masses or just yourself. I believe [app15] advancing the common good you spread the wealth of nobility to others as well as yourself and that is the greatest benefit of all.
Without TV actors/actresses wouldn't have jobs.Without TV you wouldn't know what's happening around the world. I [app5] newspapers can't fit all that in.Books and newspapers can't give you emergency warnings or updates or new flashes
bottled water is not bad for the world because after youre done drinking your bottle of water you can re-use it several times to have serval bottles of water using less plastic. plastic is also recyclable and [app12] new objects such as more plastic bottles so technically you can re-use and re-use the same plastic bottle over and over again. it will not be bad for the economy if we figure out how to reuse properly.
In 2006, the Alliance for a Healthier Generation and the American Beverage Association worked together to develop a set of National School Beverage Guidelines. This was prepared to reduce the calories delivered to schools by beverage companies and in [app13] promote healthier school choices for children. The articles illustrate the program and significant results thus far. Since its inception there has been a 58% cut in total calories contained in all beverages shipped to schools. Further, a survey was taken of parents, pediatricians and family physicians. The highest supported choice [app20] group was bottled water. (http://www.nikawater.org/bottled-water/ )
Yes, because then [app1] do what [app2] in fear of getting spanked again. Since they will know the consequence. Although, there is also a line a parent shouldn't cross such as the appropriate [app11] and abuse line.
I would [app0] husband [app1] that's just plain wrong. I would explain "How would you feel if somebody killed a family member or a close friend? Would you want them to be punished?" So for doing a wrong and to become better you have to take your consequence's.
Killing someone is wrong no matter what. If you kill someone then i think you should do the right thing and turn yourself in, instead of waiting and wondering if someone else would turn you in. I know it would be difficult for me [app14] in my wife, but they commited a horrible crime and they should pay for it. No one is above the law basicly.
I believe personal pursuit its better, because its [app2] to decide what you want to do with your life. Your not always going to have someone by your side telling you whats right or wrong. Its all [app12] of reaching their goals. Its also a good thing to help other reach their succeed their goals.
I feel like it is better to do both, but in order to help others you need to help yourself. It all starts with your personal [app8] before you [app9] others.
Although we have free speech in America if our speech incites a riot or if it is reasonable to assume that what you say could incite others to do harm or break the law then there can [app12] repercussions. The reason this so seldom happens though is because it has to be proved that the actions of others were the direct and sole result of the words or actions of another and this can be hard to do.
Since it has been 8months I doubt you will get anywhere with it. Not only that you have to prove that they knew about the damage....the court doest side on just assumptions. If I would you [app12] you buy a used car take it some place and get it looked over if the dealer ship wont allow it have the look it over and sign off that there is no damage. If you dont like this answer I would seek legal help!
It really can't in a common law jurisdiction.The concept of common law is that [app4] decisions/interpretations by courts are [app6] authority on lower courts. So, it can't be illegal for courts to do what they are [app12] do.Civil law systems (such as France, or Lousisana) work differently, and there the court holdinds are not binding in the same way as under common law.
It is legal, since there is no overtime for salaried employees. There is one caveat however, Minimum wage law still applies even to salaried employees, So calculate how many hours you work each year then divide your salary by that number -- if the result is less then federal minimum wage(5.15) or your states minimum wage(7.63 being the maximum in Washington) or even your local minimum wage(9.50 in Santa Fe) then your employer is in violation of the law.
Absolutely not, unless (A) you are a licensed real estate broker and (B) you have a pre-existing written agreement to do so signed by every estate beneficiary from whose interest the commission would be paid. As a P.R. you CAN seek additional P.R. [app14] for extra services to the estate involving sale of real estate that [app18] beneficiaries expressly consent to in writing or that a court allows on application after notice to the beneficiaries. Such additional fees must be based on such factors as additional time and [app20] over & above the routine duties of a P.R., not on a [app20] of the sale price -- which would constitute a commission.
Not every download is copyright infringment.If someone has legal ownership of a work (as its creator/author), then they are perfectly entitled to grant [app7] for anyone else to make copies and distribute them.Also, many works are either public domain or allowed by their copyright holder to be distributed under a specific license agreement (such as non-commercial use only). These are again not in volation of copyright laws.So, there are plenty of legal ways that software like limewire can be used. And as long [app20] are legal uses, and as long as the software maker doesn't intend or support illegal use to occur -- the software itself is not illegal.But using it to make unlawful copies is still illegal.
The stupid idea of "You can't get an ID without an ID". Try to explain this to them and ask THEM for their opinion on your situation. Most of the time they are helpful and will point you to the right direction.I had a similar situation with my husband. He had an old expired ID from another country and that country's consulate wouldn't give him an ID, the DMV wouldn't give him an ID. SO, we just asked the DMV what we should do? They suggested official school records, you request them and keep them sealed and [app20] DMV open them. They just want to make sure it's you. Hope that helps!
Liberals (Democrats) as they're called in the States are actually not followers of traditional liberalism. Classical liberalism is more closely followed by Libertarians and some factions of the Republican party. Extreme liberalism can be seen in some forms of anarcho-capitalism or anarchy. Just so you know.Anyway, conservatives are for the protection of a traditional way of life, of [app19] quo, of stability. Conservatives are therefore against any social upheaval or change. Conservatives feel that too much change is dangerous, destabilizing, and ultimately the death of a society, and that a strong government is needed to protect the people, even if it means restricting freedom somewhat.Moderates see the value in both. They agree that change is necessary and that freedom is important and that both can be beneficial, but that full-blown anarchy is not desirable and that the government can actually help the protection of freedom.
I really feel for you, thats a [app2] situation.Are you sure that you are really [app5] with him, as you only said that you believe you are [app9] with him. Be careful not to confuse other feelings for love.Did you [app14] was your uncle before you got involved?I know you fall [app18] with who you fall in love with but there is a brief window in which you can apply the breaks.What about the other woman he is with? Has he spoken to her yet?If I were you, I would try to steer clear and if he manages to end the relationship with the other lady and keep his relationship with the kids maybe you could think about him again.I don't know about the law and deformities. I would say no to both questions, but just think of the people involved in this tangled web and how your decisions will effect themIts [app20] I know.Good luck.
Saying you belong to a political ideology makes you dogmatic. Society is dynamic and can't go by the principles of one political ideology. Political ideologies are secular religions in this regard. Many self [app11] liberals, libertarians, and conservatives rarely listen to each other on how [app15] society. Liberals see government as the only [app18] all of society's ills. Conservatives and Libertarians find government as the mere deterrent to social ills and adhere to free market fundamentalism as holy. It's as if the free market makes everything a Utopia. These differences in dogma often resorts to divisive politics. How is that any different to religious differences?
I think the proof is in the pudding: take something you consider yourself truly knowledgable about and look at [app6] coverage. You'll find it partial at best. You'll encounter people who "read an article" related your [app12] understand how naive they sound. Journalists can only provide so much context and it's usually never enough to give a layman a foothold in the subject matter. This is not to say that news isn't valuable. But it does mean that if you read the paper every day and gravitate toward the Ukraine stories while having virtually no historical background, having never been to the Ukraine or Russia, never done any research or met people from the cultures involved, you should speak, [app20] feel with in an extremely humble tone about the subject. In fact it would be more wise to ask questions [app20] profess any opinion at all.
Of course, stop if a train is there.I think of this every time I see a truck/bus with "This vehicle [app6] at all railroad crossings" written across the back... I feel that stopping, listening for a train, and going again is much riskier than not stopping at train crossings. I feel this way for 3 reasons:1. If your [app19] stalls or you have some other kind of problem as you are are crossing the tracks, you no longer have momentum to carry you to safety.2. The act of stopping could cause another vehicle to crash into [app20] they are not expecting it.3. If for some reason you stop but don't actually hear/see a train coming for any reason (unlikely, but still a possibility), you are now on the tracks for a much longer period of time, increasing your risk.I think that the safest option just approach level crossings like every other vehicle on the road.CMV
- Lobbying is prohibited. No one is allowed to influence US politics other than by voting for their preferred candidates. Many countries do not support lobbying, and are absolutely fine.- Presidential candidates may not, under any circumstances, publicize themselves through monetary means.The White House will host debates online, and the presidential candidates (all of them, not just the two big ones) will receive an equal amount of publicity through those debates. This way, the smaller candidates aren't automatically out of the question.This also [app20] outsiders can't influence who gets [app20] by donating toward a certain candidate.I haven't given this a whole lot of thought, this actually occurred to me only 5 minutes ago. This is too simple to be without flaws, so I'm looking for counterarguments. I am also notAmerican, so I do not fully understand how your political system works. I hope this doesn't sound too stupid.
So, little about me is I'm currently a 19 year old male enrolled in college. I plan on majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. In terms of intimate relationships, they are non-existent. I have never kissed a girl, nor asked one out. Part of it is that I know they will say no. I'm not an attractive person by any means, I'm very fat and have very poor hygiene. And even, if by some miracle they said yes, the relationship would not last longer than a day at most. I consider myself to be a [app20] dude. I have weird songs on my iPod and I watch weird videos and have no hobbies other than playing video games, browsing the internet, and watching movies/TV. I feel that a person like me isn't really meant for a healthy, sexual, mature relationship with a woman of any sorts. I feel that I have to find some other meaning in my life than passing on my genes.
A pretty simple google search will result in many horror stories surrounding lottery winners. Many are forced to move from their home towns, face lawsuits from people looking for a quick buck from a deep pocket, and even have a much higher chance of being murdered.I feel that it should be a person's right to choose whether they want the public to know about their winnings.I understand that the main dissenting opinion is the idea that this could lead to people believing the whole thing is rigged, and that nobody actually wins the big jackpots. However, it's kind of ridiculous to think that hundreds of millions of dollars in jackpot money just magically disappear without any Lottery employees coming forward. Furthermore, why do we not doubt the legitimacy of other large jackpots? For a [app20] people have been buying scratch-off tickets without the ridiculous self-identification laws.
Bungies next game looks like a solid shooter with a nice setting, but I don't see how it's going to be such a revolutionary game. Frankly, it looks like Borderlands with a different [app11] and tone. But otherwise it's a solid looking FPS that focused on classes, co-op, and loot across a variety of small open world areas. How is this so revolutionary? I mean the [app20] looks good, and I like the idea of an epic quest across the solar system in my trusty spaceship, but the revelation of the ships not being flyable and there being no space combat -they're just cut scene machines- was a big disappointment for me. Please, I want to be more excited for this game than I am. But it's being hailed as the next big new thing in gaming and I just don't see it.
I am Canadian by birth but my parents are from Serbia and Croatia. I find everyone in Canada tries to hold onto their culture and wave a flag signifying their bloodline and heritage. I thought this was a good thing and clung onto it myself for a [app15] discovered I don’t need to define myself by a single (or two or three) nationality/nationalities.From what I have seen, particularly with people who have moved from their mother country and settled permanently elsewhere, it only seems to lead to bigotry and a stagnation of one's own cultural and personal development. To be Serbian or Croatian or Indian or Saudi Arabian or whatever seems to be interpreted as boldly representing the country’s main religion, beliefs, traditions, etc. at the time that the person left that country. Why can’t we accept our differences and that we as people have a developing cultural identity, and not see this as “losing” our identity? The [app20] losing this causes people to ignorant and bigoted. CMV
I'm not [app0] the popular view on reddit is about this, but in the real world, I hear arguments from both sides of the political spectrum regarding what the [app10] would have thought. I don't really think it matters because the [app14] were not gods who could prepare for any problem or know everything, they were just people. We live in a different time than the founding fathers, and even if we didn't, it isn't like the [app20] were infallible. I'm not saying the founding fathers were always wrong, but I don't think a view deserves any more merit just for being the view of one of the founding fathers. I believe political scientists should focus on what would be the best [app20] an issue instead of interpreting what the [app20] would have done.Edit: Someone pointed out that the title is a bit different from my actual opinion. I believe it is ok to respect the [app20] as experts, but not to elevate their opinions above that.
I've long struggled with this and I'd like to here some strong arguments from the other side. I know the [app6] abortion to society, but I can't justify them simply because the [app11] gain is positive - that's opening Pandora's [app13] to me.For me, just because a human cannot survive on it's own, doesn't mean we shouldn't protect them. Granted, I have absolutely no problem with suicide, so this isn't a religious "sanctity of life" issue. I simply believe that [app20] can be no informed decision made by the fetus, we have an obligation to protect it.It's an odd issue for me, I want to make abortion legal and easily accessible from a society standpoint, but I can't reach that position due to moral complications. So change my view.
In my opinion, curvy denotes an hourglass figure with with hips, boobs, and butt that stick out. Curvy is healthy body type that people have naturally. Fat isn't healthy. Curvy women don't fit into the "skinny" category because of their assets, but also aren't an unhealthy weight. I feel that it is inappropriate to call women curvy as a nicer alternative to fat because fat and curvy aren't the same thing. I feel that it is unfair and misleading to actual curvy women for fat women to use the descriptor curvy. That being said I have nothing against someone for being overweight.EDIT: I want to thank all the people who replied. I do realize that I may not hold the majority view. I should have used the word overweight rather than fat. Humans do require a [app20] of body fat to be healthy.
I'm embarassingly ignorant on [app1] of this project so perhaps some of you kind [app5] can fill me in.I'm wholly convinced that a useful stipped-down laptop can be manufactured for less than $100. When travelling, I was always issued this super-handy Asus EEE which cost about $300 USD.I'm also wholly convinced that access to [app18] infrastructure is an essential part of nation-building, but Microsoft Powerpoint is not. (In fact, that inspires a new debate topic!) Perhaps somebody can clarify for me, will these laptops have access to the internet?
I'm actually not sure you can. You see, since video games and [app4] are all we [app5] to go on, is it truly possible to kill that which is already dead? we don't really know. I think that [app13] possessed the undead to [app15] to the land of the living, I don't think we will truly be able to kill them off, since they are dead to begin with, and not be able to [app20] by our normal means.
Runes were discovered magicaly after Odin hung from Ygdrassil the world tree for 9 days, in his agony and delirium he saw visions of runes on [app8] below him him. Runes were originally symbols with magical properties and later they evolved into a kind of writing systemThe Iranian writing system of today(not [app17] its actual name is), [app19] look incredible and I think that that writing system is the most beautiful modern writing system to look at
Absolutely [app0] everyone's sense of morality is different. Thus, for example, if a pro-choicer was engaged in an abortion debate, the pro-lifer could call them moraless all they want but still not change the fact that the pro-choicer has valid points. Indeed, in many cases, morality is extremely subjective [app16] saying that someone "lacks morality" is about as [app20] an argument as "you suck".
Isn't barely helping better than not helping?And if I am going to buy an iPod either way, isn't it better to buy a red [app8] sends even a tiny fraction of the purchase price to fighting AIDS than a green one that goes better with my wardrobe but doesn't raise money for anyone but Apple?Gestures like those ridiculous Livestrong bracelets are weak, but when it's something you were already going to buy (read: NOT a stupid-looking rubber bracelet), I think that having a philanthropic option is refreshing--even if it's just a LITTLE philanthropic. The previous options weren't at ALL philanthropic.If it's no worse and it's not the same, odds are it's, well, a little better.
School uniforms take away the individuality that makes us all different. Yes, some people get into fights because of what they are wearing, but that's just us high schoolers. If we were all to wear uniforms, we would not notice who's who, and we would still get made fun of. I believe [app17] uniforms are just another way for the government to get your money.
It was just ok for me, at best. The [app3] is large but it comes across as very chain-restaurant-like. My friend had a burger and fries and I had a chicken sandwich with avocado and sweet potato fries. You get a salad first - I had caesar and my [app16] garden. The caesar salad was the highlight of my meal! It was [app20] and crisp and nicely garlicy. My friend seemed to like the garden salad ok but it looked pretty basic to me - mostly lettuce.My friend enjoyed his burger and I have to say it did look like a good burger. My sandwich came out cold, which is not a good start to a toasted sandwich. It might have been pretty good if it were hot, although it still would have been a little bland. The sweet potato fries were good, but that's not something you can't get at most pubs. It's true - the portion sizes are huge. But I do not make my meal decisions based solely on caloric intake.
Down South Blvd, right off the road is a really cool little place called Vietnam Grille. It is a crowded ( which shows how good it is) little clean restaurant. Yesterday in Charlotte it was windy and damp and cold-how perfect for Pho! We went at Lunch time when it [app16] full but got a seat very quickly and our order was taken in perfect time. We [app20] some Crispy Spring Rolls and #26 which is the Beef Pho. Spring Rolls were delicious, all the sauces on the side of [app20] went on to my plate to make a [app20] dipping sauce. The Soup arrived --Huge Bowl! Filled with a [app20] broth and noodles and [app20] and then all the extras on the side to add, the bean sprouts, Thai basil, cilantro, lemon, and jalapenos! It was piping hot and delicious..You have to try it ..I will be going back again and again!!
A great All-American sub sandwich place. The ingredients always taste fresh, and the bread is always soft. The service is always really friendly and they always [app8] sandwiches very quickly, which I appreciate. However, I am giving them four stars because on more than one occasion they have asked [app16] I wanted to add cheese to my order and I said yes, they charge me and then I get the sandwich and there is no cheese. Other than that I always have a great experience.
After reading all of the wonderful reviews on Caffe Boa I am sad to say I didn't have a good experience there. First off, let me mention I didn't taste a morsel of food. I was in the area with 4 other friends and we decided to walk in last night at about 7:30 - on a Tuesday. Our [app19] called for a reservation for 4 and when we showed up with one extra person, the hostess gave us a look of complete devastation and stress - She would have to push two tables together in a practically empty restaurant. She [app20] us and we sat, and sat, and sat. We were never greeted. Not even a water. We gave the server/manager/whomever a good 10 minutes.Well, we got up and went to Z'Tejas. I will try again - maybe on a busier night when a newly sat table may not slip through the cracks. I figure our [app20] of being acknowledged will be greater. :)
It really depends on what had happened, she would have to tell me the story and I would have to be able to sympathize with her and understand why she did what she did. If I truly felt that she was remorseful for what she did and I can sympathize with her about why she [app18] murder than maybe I could forgive her and not turn her in.
Coming from a [app1] internet user, I prefer IE because it has a sleeker design, and I find the bookmark/history thing easier. I'm using firefox though, cuz I don't want to transfer my bookmarks again after [app12] made [app13] default browser.
Farquar dealt with every day problems during the early years of Singapore.He also [app4] to know the people and understood malay, whereas Raffles hardly communicated with the people.
I think advancing the common good would be better in [app3] run. I mean sure you can worry about yourself, but put it like this, "Your not the most important person in the world". If everyone just thought about just them and not about other people where would we be. Its [app17] put others first and think about yourself later [app20] put yourself first.
I would rather have a lousy father [app2] fatherless because I would at least have the tranquility of knowing who my father is than [app8] my whole life wondering who he was. If I was to grow up fatherless I would grow [app14] emptiness in me. I would prefer growing up with a lousy father and learn from his mistakes than not having a [app20] all.
Water bottles, good or bad? Many people believe plastic water bottles to be good. But the truth is water bottles are polluting land and unnecessary. Plastic water bottles should only be used in emergency purposes only. The water in those plastic are only filtered tap water. In an emergency situation like Katrina no one had access to tap water. In a situation like this water bottles are good because it provides the people in need. Other than that water bottles should not [app20] because it pollutes the land and big companies get 1000% of the profit.
I think you should hit you kids because if [app3] something really bad like [app5] or steal you need to hit them so they know that they should not be doing that.
yes because if they fear getting hit [app2] wont do [app3]
I think [app0] should be used if it will teach thee child in [app4] run but each child responds differently to different punishments while one child just telling them no or grounding them will work on another child it may take a [app14] to teach them right and wrong.
I believe spanking is a good [app2] punish a child if nothing else works
Parents shouldn't use [app1] as an [app2] it just [app3] child get [app5] than to see what [app6] wrong.
no, spanking is not the [app1] your problems...u should talk to [app4] with [app5] understanding, for them to be able to understand they are doing wrong..
Well I understand some people are crazy in love, but for me that would [app4] crazy. Taking another persons life is never the solution or acceptable. Who knows if her next move is not towards me, who knows? If she was crazy enough to do it once, she is [app16] to do it again.
The murders of a person is a crime that cant be overlook, to sleep [app4] a person who has commited this crime, and you knowing about makes you as much responsible as that persons.
I think i will go with personal persuit because no matter what we do we think of ourself first. I think its the human nature.But personal pursuit does not mean being selfish and only caring about oneself.I need to think about me first,success and then think of others. Everyone does think of themselves before thinking about others. First i need to make me happy to make others happy. This way i [app20] my life better and be who i am.
A personal pursuit of mine has always been to be the best pole vaulter that I can be, or the best at anything you do. I [app8] that while trying to achieve this personal goal I [app12] so much about trying to be a more responsible and more obedient. I believe in pursuing personal pursuit and personal [app19] is a better endeavor simply because if you strive to be good at something, it will help you grow as a person. From my personal experience, pursuing a personal goal has helped other people in this world.
Well for me its a kind of a 50/50. I think that evryone should be less selfish and do [app6] are "advancing the common good", but then again on the other hand we live in the real world and we are going to [app14] better benifit us. For example in your job your not going to try to make another employe, your going to try to make yourself look good so that you will [app20] money.
I thing personal [app1] i believe that you have to [app3] first to accomplish your [app5] because how can you help someone if you dont help yourself. Helping yourself first would make you a [app12] and i think that after you achieve your [app15] and becoming a [app16] you would be able to help the common good.
He's a convict, she doesn't [app1] to worry about legally. There's no chance (almost...) of her being brought to trial on a perjury case, but he might be able to do something [app11] court... honestly if she has a new car she should give the car in question back just because it won't be [app18] hassle. Remember it's up to the distric attourney whether or not to bring criminal charges, and he's not likely to get involved in a family dispute like this...Even in the very obscure possibility that the DA did [app20] the case, he won't prosecute for one very good reason. The case would be based on one thing, the word of a [app20] against the word of your neice, her mother, and her grandmother. DA's don't prosecute cases they know they can't win.
I think if you(we) expect law [app2] to be able to do a certain job, then they should be duly empowered in writing to take the necessary actions, including use of force, to carry out the duties of that job. I also think that citizens should be more involved in community policing. Neighborhood watch is a great program, if there were more people out there doing it, there'd be less demand for police etc.
I don't think there are any victimless crimes, by definition. We might ask why particular laws are enacted, because they seemingly don't hurt an individual, group, or society as a whole. But you have to look at the full effect of the action to determine if there is harm to society.For example, prostitution should probably be legalized and regulated, as in many European countries. However, some aspects, such as working a street corner, cause harm to a neighborhood, and should [app20] illegal. Requiring them to work only in licensed brothels would be appropriate.Similar considerations would [app20] 'victimless' crimes.
In my personal opinion, guns are bad. They should be used only by law [app4] officials and not ordinary citizens.I lost [app7] due to an accident involving a gun, and [app10] just anyone nowadays (depending on [app12] live) can purchase a firearm without even obtaining a license in some cases, makes me cringe with frustration and disbelief!I've just recently seen a report on the TV news that claims that even owning a fake gun such as the now-famous 'paint-ball guns' can lead to serious violence and even death. In some cases, people were accidentally killed or seriously injured while playing among themselves. In other cases, they were mistakenly shot by police who believed they had pointed a real gun at them...Let's leave guns in the hands of those who know how to use them in order to protect law-abiding citizens everywhere!
Something is missing from the story. I took a look at the statute and it says that the County can seek reimbursement "for any expenses incurred by the county in relation to a charge for which a person was sentenced to a county jail" as more fully described in the statute. The statute is clear that a [app19] is required. If the charges were dismissed or you were found not guilty, then the County cannot seek reimbursement. If you were found guilty and sentenced to County jail, then you must pay. If you reached a plea agreement and were sentenced to "time served", then the County can seek reimbursement.If you [app20] in jail for 4 months, you were either convicted or you couldn't make bail while you were waiting for trial. If you were convicted, even with a plea bargain, you probably owe the money.
Lawyers are motivated by a [app1] of money and power. Without legal disputes, such as in civil matters, there would be a dramatic decline in the need for those lawyers. So, yes lawyers are trying to make you money but, the bottom line is their pocket-book, not yours!!! So, this is really a catch 22 where both sides can win big but, the lawyers assume lots of risk [app20] matters--which in some cases they make NO money, if they lose your dispute. So, before lawyers touch many civil cases they will pose some really important questions, i.e, is this a winnable [app20] is this worth my time--considering how much I (lawyer) could potentially earn?Civil law is still a popular area of law but, there is a huge need now for immigration lawyers. So, if law is your interest then consider that area.
No there are plenty of programs designed for felons to get there life back on tract. You may be able to go back to school depending on your desired [app9] get the [app11] to pay for it. You should go to your local DHS or CPS office and they will be able to refer you to where all of that information will be available for you. Good Luck!!!
No. Cops need the [app1] of the owner of [app3] to search it without a warrant or reasonable suspicion that someone's life was in danger.Edit: I wanted [app9] that it is disturbing how many people are saying your brother could let the police in. It is completely illegal. How could any reasonable person think that a 14 year-old, clearly not an adult, could have authority to consent?
Assuming such value could be reasonable calculated, then I would have no problem with a legislature passing a law like this. It meets the intent of the 5th Amendment Takings Clause, and if the state decides they want towns to play [app13] -- that can't be a bad thing.The only potential downside is the cost of litigation if lots of people start suing the towns and counties to recover what they think they might have potentially lost, based on what some zoning code did in another part of town. But that's a matter of writing the law intelligently and not allowing such legal loopholes.
Your post is a little unclear. In any event, these are really questions you should be asking your lawyer. It's his job to help you understand the consequences of [app9] any settlement offer. Write down all your questions, and then meet with your lawyer and ask him. I imagine the settlement involves having all medical bills paid, and that the $20k settlement is for your pain and suffering. Generally the lawyer will take his fee (either 1/3 of 1/4) of the settlement as his fee, depending [app20] terms of your engagement with him. So it's most likely that all medical bills will be paid, and you will get $20,000, part of which will go to [app20] to pay his fee.
I am a heterosexual male, and I can find no reason for condemning it as immoral. Though I do believe in God, I do not believe that everything in the bible is true [app11] biblical scripture does not convince me. Additionally, if something is wrong their should be observable reasons in reality, so the justification for homosexual acts being wrong should deal strictly with observable reality. The prevailing justification seems to be that homosexual acts are not natural. However, this employs the assumption that what is natural is good. This doesn't seem true to me. Vaccines are not natural, and they are not condemned. Computers are unnatural and yet they are not condemned. The act does not hurt anyone. Provide an argument showing that homosexuality is an inherently immoral act rooted in logic.
First off, I understand that sour cream is already available in a squeezable container. My view is that this should be the *standard* type of container. It [app9] sold in a cup container with a lid, similar to yogurt.Most of the time sour cream is used, it would be more useful in a squeeze type of container, similar to ketchup or mustard. Yes, *sometimes* it may be more convenient to have a yogurt type of container, making it easy to scoop with a spoon. But a large majority of the time, it is used as a topping, which would be [app20] to apply with the squeeze of your palm.CMV.
I'm not sure why, but I completely feel that if you made plenty of money doing the shittiest job on earth, you should be content.Example, if I made 100k a year from a job that I am not [app12] content with, I would prefer that over a job where I make 60-70k a year and enjoyed the 8 hour day.I feel this way because in my opinion, if you made good money with a job that (for you) has low job satisfaction, the time you have off will be even better because you have the money to be able to afford and do whatever you wanted, versus being happier with your job but not having the things you want in life.I feel I'm at a serious turning point in my life, and I want to make sure I look at all angles of opportunities presented to me.Please CMV!
Hi everyone,After watching [app1] recently, it really does seem that the cracks in the EU since the recession are starting to get [app7] because of foreign policy matters with Russia. Hearing that some member states (UK mainly) are really watching the elections sort of had me thinking if Europe could ever be a unified body. Dissolving of the EU would [app20] terrible for the region because of [app20] nationalistic [app20] making a comeback into the political scene. That nationalism, I believe, will create animosity between countries, which, in a worst case scenario, lead to another war.I really hope I am not being too doom and gloom with this post, but I would really like to hear more about this subject. Please pardon my ignorance if this comes off as so, but I would really like to learn a bit more about what might happen and maybe CMV.Thanks!_____
The drinking age should be 16. There is very strong anecdotal evidence from societies where [app5] drinking is socially acceptable from an early age. In these countries, such as France, there is a significantly lower rate of drinking-related diseases and deaths. If [app14] drinking is integrated into a society, it can seriously curb binge drinking when one reaches 18, 19 or 21. Furthermore, these extra years of alcohol sales can increase tax revenue and fund programs that help those afflicted with alcoholism to recover.
Ocarina of time is better than Majora's Mask. Both games were fun to play, and MM was a great compliment to OoT, but OoT just stands out on top of MM. We're talking about what most people [app12] as the best game ever made. OoT successfully brought the Zelda series into the 3D realm, and gave us a massive world to explore [app20] of the most engrossing stories ever to be found in a video game. OoT was one of my first game addictions, and the game that got me into the Zelda series. Brilliantly designed and executed, and still regarded by many as the best game in the series. All honors need to go to Ocarina of Time.
I'll start. Obviously I can't know if I would actually go through with it should I find myself in this position, but I'm at least willing to entertain the possibility. Were I suffering early onset Alzheimer's or similar mental decline I would consider ending my life. The ability to maintain a continuous [app17] is what makes me who I am. At the point where I lose my grip on reality, forget who I am, forget what I am, forget what I believe, then I cease being me. I would consider ending my life in this case.
My [app0] I agreed that this was the best sushi of our lives. And he would follow that up with also saying "and I've had a shit load of sushi"Seriously - don't go to one of the many overpriced places in Vegas or one with all the deep fried cream cheese roll crap. Drive to Boulder City and eat here. Worth the price of a rental car
Really really [app0] dining experience here. I [app2] Angel Hair Pomodoro [app4] the cheese off so it was vegan. SO. GOOD. The [app8] basil was the highlight, pasta was perfect, and that alone makes it 5 stars. However ... The best part of dinner aside from the food was our server, Alyssa. She was attentive, familiar with what was vegan on [app20] (!!!!!) and always making sure our drinks were [app20] up. Definitely ask for her when you come! I will when I go back for sure. It's always a good dining experience when the [app20] is as helpful and kind as the food is delicious. This was an A+ experience. Very happy.
I don't go to jack in the [app2] often. However I've never really had a bad experience with one. The service here sucks. I've come here twice with this last instance being the last time I bother.I've walked in both times. It took about [app14] minutes to get a single jumbo jack last time. It wasn't busy. Today it took 3 minutes with me being the only person in line and two people looking right at me and not taking my order before I left. Management should consider an overhaul of their employees. 5 guys will continue to get my business over you. They seem to take less time than you do and they're a walk in burger place.
atmosphere here was very nice and a good date spot [app3] was a little confusing because it was in Italian I think but the waiter was happy to helpI got the seafood linguine as recommended as the waiter as a popular dish The food took quite a while to arrive but we did get free bread with olive oil but it was quite hard and dry so I did not really like it and didn't eat itwhen we got the food we were quite disappointed by the portion as it was expensive for the small portion we got. we easily demolished the noodles in 5 min and felt hungry even after [app20] around $25. the noodles themselves [app20] and flavourful and they add cheese at the top but [app20] price so only come if you're willing to splurge or have a small stomachoverall I would not come again due to the high price tag and the small portions
We talk about how schools destroy creativity and uniforms are a classic example of that destruction. In most schools with uniforms the students are given the occasional day to were their [app10] clothes but are then given strict guidelines as to what is acceptable. This is effectively turning "casual clothes" into a twisted "causal" uniform.
I think [app0] uniform is a bad idea because its too much work to clean the uniform and its a pain if you have to put on a lot of stuff in the mmorning
I can reconfigure Firefox very easily to meet my needs as my life changes. If I need great SEO extensions I can get them. If I need an HTML color picker instead when I [app11] involved with other elements of site development, FF is easily remodeled to suit my new browsing needs. The breadth and variety of FF add-ons is a critical advantage.
No, I wouldn't [app1] I would [app3] like. You [app4] I had know part in it. And we are just going to go our separate ways. But truthfully I wouldn't want to know in the first place.
If [app0] had [app1] a murder I think I would not turn him [app4] my feelings would be stronger that the [app7] having a bad husband, I am not sure of my exact answer but I am sure that I couldn't look at him everyday and act like nothing happened, I believe that feeling are stronger than anything and I would not like the fact that he would [app20] sentenced to death or [app20] rest of his life in prison.
If it was the person you truly [app2] want to spend the rest of your life with then it's a definitely no. People make mistakes but although it's a major crime to murder someone I would still not turn in the person I love the most. If I plan on staying with that person I love for the rest [app20] life then I would stick with them and never turn them in. And if that means that I am part of that murder [app20] saying anything, well then so be it.
In my opinion, I believe it is better to be [app3] to have a lousy father. I [app6] know how it feel to have a lousy father but I have friends that there fathers are always drunk and never do anything to help them. They sometimes tell [app16] wish there dad wasn't around. Now if my dad was like that I would think the same because at least [app20] having a father you [app20] know how it feels to be dissapointed by a father.
I used to be a firefox user but I only have 2GBs of RAM on my system and I like to use more than one [app8] at a time. Firefox sucks up way too much memory to justify the [app13] two advantages.
Yes. Physical education, if taught and encouraged [app2] and [app3] with the right attitude, will be rewarding [app5] student and teacher.
I think it is great [app1] make physical education be mandatory in school because it will be healthy for the student to become a healthy person and they will not have the risk of obesity.
William Farquhar [app0] in Singapore longer than Raffles, so Farquhar had more time to get to know the people more, to earn the trust of the people, to find out the problems that the people were facing and to solve those problems
Well me personally I think advancement of the common good is better. I don't really know how to back this up, I just know its the way i feel about the topic. I guess because I'm not a selfish person at all when it comes to anything. I believe in sharing and helping others out. So if there's something i have to sacrifice personally for the [app20] of the common good, 9 times out of 10 I'm going to do it.
Bottled water produces up to 1.5 million tons of plastic waste per year. Plastic requires up to 47 million gallons of oil per year to produce. And while the plastic used to bottle beverages [app11] high quality and in demand by recyclers, over 80 percent of plastic bottles are simply thrown away.
One of the key component to Christianity is FAITH. Just [app3] you can't see it doesn't mean it's not there. Gravity, for example, you can't see it, feel it, or hear it, but you know it's there. Faith to Christians is the same way.
Yes, I would [app1] spouse in. Who is to say that if they killed once that they wont kill again. Who is to say that you aren't there next target. If they were to ever become paranoid about being caught they might just blow out your brains because paranoia makes you do crazy things. It would be hard [app19] them [app20] you have a deep connection with your spouse but it's something you have to do for your own safety.
A personal pursuit is more [app1] me, because every person is responsible [app4] and their own actions. Advancing the common good would just mean that [app9] two people may not have to work as hard as you would for the same thing because of something you may have done. A personal pursuit can never be inequal. You'll always be able to dig yourself as deep into a hole as you want to, but standing as [app20] rather than many, you could probably dig faster if you were alone.
it is [app0] before you [app2] others. for instance, if you don't have your life together how are you going to help someone else with theirs. if your still living at home with your mother and you don't have a job [app15] want to help out by giving to an organization you couldn't do it. so basically you have to [app20] before you [app20] others.
What a great question!Only in an ideal world do ideals work in an ideal way. In our real world, it [app6] more likely for a poor person to be convicted of a felony than a rich person. So effectively, when EX-felons are denied the franchise, poor communities are denied equal representation. Read some law articles on the difference between de facto and de jure; I'm sure you'll find the subject interesting and enlightening.
No, you still have to pay your rent,but here is a few things you can do:If the landlord does not [app6] repair the tenant can do any of the following:Take the rent when it is due to the local [app13] of courts. A tenant must be current in their rent with the [app17] of courts (called rent deposit). The tenant does not need an attorney for rent depositing. Apply to the court to order the landlord to [app20] repairs. The court can also lower the rent until the repairs are made or give the tenant some of the rent money so the tenant can have the repairs made. End the lease. Cancel the rental agreement and move. This can be done only after the tenant has given appropriate notice, and the landlord has failed to correct the condition.
Although adultery may actually be against the law [app2] live, and although you may have a cause of action for alienation of affection, what you really have is mislaced anger.This woman was not coming to your home. She was invited to your home by your husband. She was not making out with him. Your husband was making out with her. And she did not get pregnant. Your husband got her pregnant.This woman did nothing to you. Your [app20] did. Make sure to divorce him. Get a good settlement, maintenance and child support. The best revenge is a life well lived.
Depends what the contract says, I suppose. It may call for mutual satisfaction or give you a right to ask for them to be redone. Most likely you have to pay anyway.However, the issue may not be best approached by means of your "legal recourse." If you haven't done so, tell the designer how unhappy you are and why, and ask that the designs be redone. It may be that the designed will work with you to redo the work -- it would be in the designers' long-run best interests to see that his/her customers are happy with the design.
Ok, hun, he's [app1] and I [app2] that you are a minor? First thing, he should have never put you in a criminal situation to begin with. Obviously he didn't care enough about you to keep you out of possibly going to jail, so I would just let him sit in there and think about what he has done....if he is a man at all, he should be the one apoligizing to you.
Is it possible, sure. Your question is difficult to answer because it really depends on the practice of a particular courthouse or judge. Many federal courts require individuals with cell phones, pagers, blackberrys, etc. to leave them with the Marshal Service.If a judge has a standing policy against such things in his courtroom, whether [app18] off, you could be held in contempt. My guess is that most judges wouldn't go as far as to hold someone in contempt if it was off. But I've personally seen a person's phone get confiscated b/c there was a concern that the individual was attempting to take [app20] of witnesses with it in a drug case (i.e.--witness intimidation).
The whole thing sounds pretty dodgy to me. An extension without the proper footings is not legal and if it has been built without [app8] that to is not legal.The letter that you write should not [app12] help them make a sale on a property that has parts that could fall down in a gale and perhaps cause injury. It should [app20] state that it had only been built for the time that it has and that the building should be inspected as there are no proper foundations. If you knowingly write an incorrect statement and the truth comes out then you could be caught for aiding and abetting an illegal sale. The whole thing is a mine [app20] so either stay out of it altogether or put the local authority in the picture. The estate agent should [app20] made [app20] of the problem as he could be in real trouble.
My wife was severely abused as a child (no details) We are happy in our marriage and she is an excellent wife and partner. So the answer is yes but it requires patience and understanding. As far as your plight I will wish you the best on finding true love, it [app17] and it [app18] over 50. But if there is no trust in that one you are crazy about then move on. Lies have no place in a relationship.
Your best bet would [app1] get legal counsel to accompany you to court and explain your rights to you. Not knowing why you and your daughters father are not together my advice can only be very generalized. If he refuses to pass a drug screening, then [app15] his custody will not go through because when this case presents before a judge and you mention drug activity, the judge may order a drug test. If he fails to comply with the court order there is no way he will get custody. Although I am not personally in the legal field, I have had to deal with custodial battles many times in my line of work and it is never a happy trail. I wish you all the luck.
It's a little pointless and egotistical to do so. The idea of this site is that we collect [app6] from various viewpoints, and then allow others to judge the [app9] the content.Voting for your own answer defeats the purpose, so certainly is unethical. It's [app15] against Yahoo!'s rules too.I can't imagine how [app18] feel they've 'won' by voting on their own answers - it seems SO childish. There are no prizes and no bragging rights here - we're all just trying to share our experience and information.
The Supreme Court has ruled on this already and as long as the first Amendment is not altered, abortion should be legal.The S.Court ruled abortion should be legal based on a person's 1st Amd right to privacy [app12] happens to their body. It has nothing to do with when life begins,etc... as some would like it to. It is all about this great country's [app20] and constitution giving us protections over our personal self.
STOP! before retaining an attorney $$$, consider contacting the business and informing them of the incident and request the name of their ins. provider. Often they make reasonable offers. (in this case doc bill plus $1000)Only if they refuse and your injuries/damages exceed your states max. small claims award by $1000 should you even consider discussing the matter [app19] attorney. Unless you were [app20] and treated professionally (have a bill) your case is weak. Damages for pain and suffering with this type of occurance will be aprox. $1000 unless you can prove the incident was the result of negligence or malice. If you hire an attorney it is likely there won't be enough money [app20] pay [app20] for your care.
If [app0] that its necassary yes...but are you still going to be able to work and bring in your own income? These semi truck drivers carry insurance and yes some of them carry million dollar insurance but not all of them go after the company he is driving for dont [app17] him..he probably feels guilty about it every day of his life. I am very sorry for your pain.Good Luck to you
Especially since it is shunned by everyone if someone other than a dark colored person used the word. It [app6] something that only one "race" can use and that is racist. If I am being to vague on why I have my opinion feel free to ask me questions. I am very interested in a debateI am aware that **censorship** is very related to my question and is an **entirely different debate**. I want to know why my opinion that using the word is wrong and **not** about how **implementing a censorship would work.**
I go to the movies a lot and it seems to happen pretty often that when the film finishes people in the [app7] will clap. I've never understood this as no one [app10] a part in making the film can hear the clapping. I could understand if it was a special screening, premiere, or there was an actor from the film or a special guest in the audience. But for normal movie-going circumstances, it just doesn't make any [app20] me. Please change my view so I can stop getting annoyed when a theatre full of people clap.
Point 1 - [app1] is the only effective means of [app3] measurement and is [app4] evaluate if a system is working properly.Point 2 - education changes over time and requires ever changing curriculum and methods in order to prepare students for modern life.Point 3 - teachers must continue to learn these new methods and changing curriculum in order to effectively lead the learning process.Point 4 - standardized [app20] prior to each school year would allow teachers to be moved where most effective, or removed all together if they are no longer effective at leading the learning process.Point 5 - high performing teachers could [app20] more if the underperforming teachers were removed from the labor pool.
With how close the world has come to annihilating itself because of leaders who've been a bit trigger happy (Cuban Missile Crisis) I truly believe nukes are pretty much the only reason the world isn't in major conflict right now.The Cold War for example. If the US and the Soviets didn't have their nuclear arsenal, what reason would Stalin, Khrushchev, etc have for NOT invading the rest of Europe? They could've easily done so and not much the US could've done to stop them. Our greatest and most terrifying weapons are pretty much our salvation and force us to cooperate even if we don't like each other.
Gravity is only a theory, therefore it should not be taught in schools because it is not absolute. A theory, as science details is not a law and we should not be teaching our kids speculative notions about the world as fact. Remove teaching the theory of gravity from schools [app16] least include in science class other notions to explain the phenomena we speculatively call gravity.
It depends on the game genre...for FPS, RTS, MMORPGs, and racing games I prefer PC Gaming because I'm way more accurate with a mouse and keyboard than a controller, and my PC's steering wheel + gadgets [app12] racing games much more fun than a controller does as well.Pretty much every other genre however seems to benefit from the console controllers, side-scrollers, action RPGs, RPGs, sports, etc etc etc.
Just a cool debate1. the death penalty [app2] with the Eighth Amendment in the constitution.2. retribution is another word for revenge based on both definitions.3. the U.S. executes a small [app10] of those convicted of murder, and these defendants are typically not the worst offenders but merely the ones with the fewest resources to defend themselves, showing that the legal system is unbalanced.4. once an inmate is executed, nothing can be done to make amends if a mistake has been made. Since 1973, at least 121 people have been released from death row after evidence of their innocence emerged showing mistakes had been made.5. not enough research has been made to except the deterrence effect.
I think 1984 could be the 'best' in the sense that it is the most prophetic which was, to some degree, Orwells intention. I feel that 1984 like all the best [app10] in the world fulfils its function beautifully i.e. form follows functions. However, I have to admit to not having read the other three books on the list and can consequently only offer this solitary opinion.
Had my first experience at Butterblume today. I found out about it through Eater Montreal. We got there around 1:45 on a Saturday, the place was full so we had to wait around 25 minutes to get a [app12] (for 5). The place is a restaurant, cafe and a boutique which is convenient in case you have to wait as you can get a coffee at the counter and take a look at the small boutique. The [app20] is very special and not traditional. They have a breakfast and lunch section as well as a small brunch one. The meals are unique, combining interesting ingredients together as well as different textures, and the [app20] and flavors are really good. We had the Israeli couscous and salmon salad to share and I had the frittata with tuna for main dish. Both were excellent. The place is nicely decorated, with a lot of white and plants, it is spacious and the acoustic is good.Will definitely go back
We visited this delightful restaurant last night and were seated on the lovely patio. The atmosphere was perfect and we were able to visit and carry on a conversation. The [app10] attentive and professional. We had the Brussels sprout salad, which was one of the best salads I've ever eaten, and the ribeye taco platter. The steak was cooked to perfection and was very flavorful. It was truly one of the best meals I've [app20] a long time. My [app20] I actually split [app20] it was just enough. For dessert we had the pistachio gelato which was also amazing. I highly recommend this restaurant.
My only complaint about Kafein is the obnoxiously loud rave music they often have blaring in the middle of the day. The food is delicious, they have a fantastic tea selection, and the [app11] are friendly and competent. I get that it's a bar in the evening, but it presents itself as a welcoming place for students to study during the day, so why blast music that no one could possibly concentrate to?
Although the food I have here is generally excellent and delicious, I can't give it a 5. My biggest issue is that it's so HOT in side! Like I was sweating buckets and I'm usually the one that's always cold! And I've come here at least 4 times now and it continues to be super hot. Also [app19] is pretty inconsistent. Sometimes we get our food super fast and sometimes we get it super slow. Sometimes the app comes after our noodles have arrived. I don't [app20] mind that it comes after but it's [app20] that gyoza takes that much longer than my noodles lol. Everything is fresh tho so all in all, still good, but I really hope they fix the temperature soon!
In my opinion it is better to be fatherless then to have a lousy father. I say this because if you have a lousy father than you have to deal with him and be ashamed of him. You would have to go day by day and [app15] is never going to be anything special, especially for you. But if you don't have a father you can always look up to someone else for that father figure.
Sir Raffles is the rightful founder because ,he increased the [app3] Singapore by using the Straits of Malacca as a trading route. He established free trade [app9] many people came to Singapore to trade with each other, boosting Singapore's economy.
Raffles was responsible for Singapore's boost of economyHe increased the economy of Singapore by using the Straits of Malacca as a trading route.He established free trade [app8] many people came to Singapore to trade with each other, boosting Singapore's economy.Raffles was responsible for Singapore's boost of economy
Farquhar was the one to take charge of the new settlement and keep it running against all odds after British [app6] was introduced, as Raffles had to return to Bencoolen.
William Farquhar was removed from his position by Raffles because Farquhar had grown too close to the people. However, knowing the people well is [app8] help Farquhar solve the problems faced by the people.
Well, I take the [app1] of my parents, because of the way they try to make me, my brother, the rest of the family and friends happy. they would spend all of there money and time on others than themselves.
I say the common [app1] of the type of forces that you [app4] as a whole group. like that [app7] says [app8] not voting they are not making a difference and when you look at the whole the population or [app14] is bigger than of those who did vote. So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking [app20] with the same views.
I believe that the school uniform is a good [app3] school uniform improve student attendance and student doesn't spend a lot of time to choosing and buying clothes for school, espeacilly girls. That is why they can use more time to study.
TV is better than books because the educational programs on TV are much more convenient and easy to understand. It is also easy to use for people who cannot see or hear. Books are also likely to be not updated with latest information about a certain topic while [app16] from TV can [app17] more accurate and useful.
Americans spend billions on bottled water every year. Banning their sale would greatly hurt an already struggling economy. In [app6] the actual sale of water bottles, the plastics that they are made out of, and the advertising on both the bottles and packaging are also big business. In [app16] this, compostable waters bottle are also coming onto the market, these can be used instead of plastics to eliminate that detriment. Moreover, bottled water not only has a cleaner safety record than municipal water, but it easier to trace when a potential health risk does occur.(http://www.friendsjournal.org/bottled-water) (http://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/bottled/)
India does have ptential to lead the world, [app2] does China! America continues to outsource good manufactoring jobs to these countries resulting in an economic boost for India and China!
Yes, [app0] use spanking as an [app2] their children, but it should be the last option.
I think that children should get spanked once in a while. I got spanked when I was little but I could definitely say that I did learn lessons. Don't spank your kids though with [app11] find, you don't want to kill them !!
In my personal opinion if you better yourself in [app3] run you can better the world. I mean you have to focus on yourself before you can take on the problems of the world and trying to fix them, or you [app14] up having a break down or something.
If i say that advencing the commen good is better then a personal pursuit, then i would be lieing to myself. Everyone wants to do good in the world, but the problem with that is that their is too many bad things happening in the world, and what you do wont really make a difference. A personal persuit does more for you then trying [app20] the commen [app20] a world [app20] see very little good.
I feel like a personal [app1] better. You can't help others around you if you can't help yourself. If your personal [app7] to make money for the needy or the common good, then it starts with you and your desire to make that money. A personal pursuit isn't always about money but it can also about happiness, love, and success.
If he is unhappy about your dogs. Then that's where your problem is. Either you find a good home for the [app7] or train your [app8] or move out to a house to keep neighbourly peace. But its really up to you. Most likely he is gathering evidence that your dog is indeed behaving badly or out of control. If your [app20] are really doing something that is damaging or noisey then it would be a good [app20] train the dogs. I've lived in an apartment and co-operation and sensitivity and tolerlance is sometimes not easy. But such is the [app20] living in a apartment. Two wrongs doesn't make a right. How many options do you have? You can't evict the guy. More complains to the authorities is not going to get you anywhere.
For the same reason you have to pay for hair cuts, lawyers services, tax services, and doctors visits. There are expenses iincurred in providing a service including salaries.Because a school is a business, the school (business) provides you (the client) with [app13] of teaching and in exchange you (the client) pay money to cover the costs of providing that service because you (the client) are the one who will benefit from that education. Chin Up. Unless you are in a private college which does not accept government funds, what you pay in tuition is about half the actual cost of your education. Alumni associations and [app20] (who will not directly benefit from your education) are paying the rest.
He drives too fast for you? Speed up yourself as much as possible. If he is speeding or driving recklessly, then the cops can ticket him. There is no law that says the managers must hold back pizzas [app12] you can deliver them. In fact, it goes against every cannon of customer service. The faster the delivery the better (as long as nobody gets injured).
Brian Doyle not only got what he deserved he should have gotten it for the last time he did it. Without law [app7] being able to improvise criminals would run amok in this country. It is hard enough anymore just to get a [app14] with all the legal loopholes created by liberal lawyers in this country much less anyone doing any serious time for such illicit behavior. I assure you if it was your 14 year old daughter that [app20] sexually assaulted by this guy you would be stomping your feet and complaining that law [app20] didn't do enough. Law Enforcement did not Enable him he was seeking out a 14 year old girl. Don't confuse the issues. This guy is and was a pedophile and preyed on little children period.
I don't know if this fits in with the emphasis in your class, but this is my personal view...Historically, when human rights were being defined women were not included.For example: The US Constitution was written to protect and [app12] the rights of citizens of the newly-formed United States. Women, however, were not believed to have all of the rights enshrined in that document and had to struggle to have their rights as citizens recognized..Although any discussion of human rights includes women by definition, the overall umbrella of "human rights" is not always seen as addressing issues specific to the female gender. These issues include child-bearing, sexual abuse and oppressive cultural traditions/laws which prevent women from enjoying the "human rights" that men have.In a nutshell, when someone says "women's rights" they are talking about human rights that women do not have yet---or they are discussing something gender-specific.I hope this helps.
If you get caught, then the theater [app2] has the discretion to remove you from the theater and/or ban you from ever coming back. This is dishonest-- it is stealing. If you paid to see one film, and then sneak in to see a second film, then you have cheated the theater out of ticket sales. You also may be affecting the box office totals for the film you saw but didn't pay to see.People do this all the time and get away with it, but it is still not right.
Please don't be misled by the [app2] responder. You are correct in asking your question. Most likely, unless you have been served by court documents you are probably still married. There is an off chance that your [app12] found an attorney that circumvented the service of process laws and your [app16] could still have been granted a divorce where ever he is without you knowing. There is no easy way to find out, but a good divorce attorney or PI may be able to, [app20] a divorce has been granted somewhere. If you want to be divorced, your best bet is to initiate divorce proceedings yourself. Your attorney can serve your husband by publication if he cannot be located and you will be granted a divorce.
First of all, what your stepson is doing is libel, because it is in written form. Slander is oral, which he may [app7] doing, but since he's sending letters, it's libel.If you're serious about stopping him, start with the police. Libel laws vary from state to state, it may not be a criminal matter in New York, and they will be able to tell you that. If it is a civil matter, speak with an attorney about bringing a case against your stepson and what a reasonable expectation of the outcome might be. It might not be [app20] time, effort, and money involved if your stepson has no assets to lose, etc.
I've lost all hope for a progressive movement in this country. I have been defending him for 6 years to all my conservative friends (in a *very* red State) while he: kept Guantanamo open, bailed out the banks, passed the GOP alternative to single payer, kept the wars going in Iraq and Afghanistan, stood firm with the NSA, etc, etc.Hillary Clinton will probably win the Democratic primary, and will probably be the next President, and if anything she will be even less progressive than the disappointment that is Obama.Please, change my view before I become a 25 year old husk of a man
Let me begin by saying I love bulldogs, pugs and [app3] in general. However due to designer breeding, these short nose type of [app7] have terrible problems breathing and a host of other health problems are generally expected. Every bubble of air is a struggle, which is probably a factor of why they sleep so much and probably is a cause for several of those health problems. I suppose there is optional surgery to increase airflow, but the vast majority of owners don't opt to do it. It breaks my heart to see these amazing [app20] gasping for air, I can imagine all the health problems I'd have if I had to struggle [app20] breath. If I am misinformed please help, I'd love to own a beautiful bully but I'd feel terrible for all these reasons.
I believe that socialism is better than capitalism. The basis of capitalism is that the hard working have a comfortable life and the non hard workers have a relatively less comfortable life. Sometimes, the people with the less comfortable life work extremely hard only to scrape by. In socialism, every single person has a relatively equal income. I'm not talking about Communism in which there is no currency or ownership, but a market in which everyone is free to spend but the poor are uplifted and the rich are taxed. According to capitalists, socialism corrupts. Under socialism, ideally everyone should have an equal life, can you please try to CMV and offer good arguments for the [app20] capitalism?EDIT: Thank you for [app20] answers and apologies for not being so clear. You have all definitely showed me the pros to capitalism, and helped me remove the connotation of socialism to a perfectly equal society.
I believe natural rights, i.e. *"...those not contingent [app2] laws, customs, or beliefs of any particular culture or government, and therefore universal and inalienable..."* do not exist.I believe all rights given to any human are social constructs, produced by society from moral structures determined by a multitude of factors. However, all of these rights can be removed in some way, and are not somehow intrinsically given to a human at birth.To clarify, I am defining a "right" as a guarantee of access to a commodity [app20] of being, without [app20] referring to a legal structure.Please, CMV!
It was after I did some research and talked to friends and family that I personally learned how big this vaccinations and anti vaccinations topic is. In my opinion, it should be up to the parents whether or not kids get vaccinated. Some people don't get vaccinated and live long healthy lives and some people do and the same thing happens. I would assume this is because of our biology. Of course vaccinated people get sick and people who aren't vaccinated get sick. My conclusion is why should people be forced to vaccinate kids if they don't want to. They should be informed of the pros and cons of their decision and make an informed decision and people should be satisfied with that.
Neuroscientists have studied the brain extensively and not found anything resembling a 'center of consciousness' in the brain which actually causes our consciousness.This begs the question: [app8] source of [app9] or internal source of consciousness?We could just as easily be a host for [app14] which has an external source, as we could be just a random accidental chemical self-awareness.Just because fiddling with the brain fiddles with perception does not mean that our [app20] is sourced in the brain for the same reason that breaking your speakers does not [app20] livestream you're watching went silent.So [app20] have no scientific reason to believe that we will just go to sleep and never wake up, but it philosophically makes sense in a universe with so many cyclical systems that we are just reborn. You dont have to believe in rebirth but there is no scientific basis for either external or internal [app20] and no scientific basis for the belief that death is just a black abyss.
Let's say that he continues with the plan to move the Jews to Madagascar or does nothing at [app6] them. He conquered a [app8] land than Napoleon or Rome and in a shorter amount of time. He brought great empires like Russia, France and UK almost or to their knees. Something that the Germans of the previous generation wished they could do during WWI. He made Germany rise from the ashes like a phoenix and get [app20] for Versailles. He also planned the Autobahn which is a modern architectural masterpiece. I believe that if it weren't for the horrors of genocide Germans would be a [app20] proud of their history.
You see the videos of people getting surprised at their graduation [app3] school/work by a military member coming home. You think wow that's nice how happy they are. But think about it. Especially in the case of a graduation, the child has to then go days or *weeks* with the disappointing thought that mom or dad isn't going to be there. That's sucks. If it were me, I'd rather be saved that heartache in the first place rather than get surprised. I'd want to know immediately that my mom or dad or son was coming home early. Making me feel sad about it longer than necessary, and **lying** to me is a dick move. Would anyone who has been surprised by a military family member please chime in?
I often read people talking about the idea of natural rights which are universal and inalienable. I contend such rights are simply constructs, and have no basis beyond any other construct humanity has created.While there can be some appeal to human nature, nearly all universal behaviour that could be classified as rights only apply to the "in-group" and certainly none seem to apply to humanity as a whole. The extension of rights to cover everyone a construct, and not part of fundamental human nature. This is why law exists in general. It's an extension of tribal self-rule for larger groups.There is certainly nothing about the nature of reality that causes rights to exist. I'd like to hear some good arguments as to why rights are not constructs.
I realise that this has been asked before but I'd like to get some [app4] thoughts. So I don't really have a definition for greatest and so I guess it's open for interpretation. So, the US has the largest GDP in the world (more than double the second place country, China). The US donates more money to charity/aid organisations than any other country. The US tends to be the entertainment capital of the world (I realise that Bollywood makes more films but I'm just saying over all: quality movies, pop songs, TV shows, video games). The US has most of the greatest universities in the world. I get that USA has a lot of problems (mass shootings, excessive military spending, political standoffs, &amp;c. ad infinitum). But that being said, for the US to not be the best country another country has to be declared the best. So who is it? The UK? China? Make your case.
PCs are cheaper with more powerful hardware.Mac's use generic hardware, not specific apple hardware as is often believed.People also believe that Mac's breakdown or need to be replaced less often than PCsIf you ever work in an environment (as I have) where Macs are networked together andused as the primary computer, you will see that Macs are just as perceptible to problems as Pcs.In fact, we bought a number of Pro machines, which had a 100% failure rate in the 3 [app20] were used.
In the Lion King, a Good Character actually dies, which gives the movie a much more serious and dramatic undertone than Aladdin. Besides my personal preference for drama!, [app9] movie more layered and thus suitable for more kinds of people, which means there's a bigger target audience, which [app17] potential revenue bigger.Plus, the Lion King got more Oscar Nominations than Aladdin, so there!
We see different colours all the time. Most of them are shades of other colours. For instance, the Rebecca Black Friday music video. When she is singing about how to-day is Friday, there is a weird and very exotic colour that appears on the screen. I had never seen that shade of purple before in my life and my brain did not explode.
Evolution has been backed by science including DNA tracing as well as by archaeological findings such as Lucy.Evolution just states that species can evolve in order to adapt to their environment.Humans have evolved most likely from apes in that their DNA's are very similar and they have some of the same behavioral patterns as us. These would be things like using tools to find their food.While evolution is a scientific theory, it is not what the average use of the term means. Most people say theory about [app20] haven't been proven yet and there [app20] doubt. This is NOT the case. A scientific theory can only become fact when there is absolutely everything discovered about it.Gravity is only a scientific theory as well as the theory of relativity. Seeing how gravity is largely believed to be true even as it is a theory it seems ridiculous to condemn evolution as needing proof.Therefore, we can say that evolution is more credible a theory than creationism.
Had a wonderful experience here! My date had prime rib and I had a burger with 3 different types of [app6] in it I believe. My date loved the prime rib and her mashed potatoes and my burger was cooked to a perfect medium. In fact the burger was incredible, just writing this review makes me want to go get another now. Only downside I would have to say was the Mac and cheese. I did get to speak with the [app20] and it's a new item and they are working on the item. We r definitely going back!
Cool atmosphere... almost like your in a wooden cabin. Fits in excellent with the Canadian 'comfort-food' theme. I've had a few dishes here, the lobster roll, PEI mussels, & boneless back rib burger, all of which I'd recommend. The [app13] noodle however, is scarce - I've missed it all three visits. Alas, perhaps next time, as I will surely be going back.
Food was actually amazing and our [app2] Samantha (I think) was very nice. However, it took the hostess a while to notice us and when she went to seat us she ran to [app11] leaving us running after her to catch up. Also, I think Samantha may have given herself an extra $3 tip on our card charge. Our bill was $47 and some change, I left a $10 cash tip. When I looked at my [app20] account I had a $50 charge. I would have went back and questioned it but we didn't keep our receipt [app20] wasn't a way to prove it. Mistake on our part, so watch out for that!!!!!
Probably the best [app1] authentic Thai food I've had in Arizona. (Tried 2 curries and pad Thai) But that's not why I gave this place 5 stars. After my girlfriend ordered her curry a little too spicy for her taste (and [app14] a good amount), we asked the waiter if he could lessen the spice and he [app19] the kitchen only to [app20] with a brand new curry (and rice) cooked with less spice. Oh and we got free [app20] cream! How cool is that!?!
I was extremely disappointed in the food portions for [app3] point or maybe I'm just bitter that this place took over Messinis. I gave 1 star because I had high expectations = fail, it had big shoes to fill (messinis) = fail, food portions for price point = fail, missing items in my take out order, the juice was good but it better be if it costs $7.I will always try a new place once. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this place or go back again.
