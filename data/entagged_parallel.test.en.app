Honestly, I'd rather be completely fatherless, not saying that not having is better than having one, albeit a lousy one. However, I do believe that you can grow up completely fatherless and without any major male role model and still be successful. Take myself for example; I lived the first thirteen years of my life without a father or any fatherly interaction, and those were the essential times a kid needed to be around his/her father, I turned out great(Self-opinion). So yes, as opposed to having a lousy father that would rub off on me and mold me into half a man, I would much rather being fatherless.
I would say that i would turn them in because i don't think that's right, killing someone and getting away with it, and also i wouldn't want to be next to a murderer on my bed.
Yes I believe gay marriage should be allowed. Mosy who do not want it to be allowed just dont like homosexuality all together, and therefore the opposing side tends to be prejudice. If two men or two women are happy together, love each other, and want to be with each other forever why shouldn't they be allowed to get married??
I am not a lawyer, and you should probably speak to one about this, but here's my two cents. The full legal text says, "You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works."Determining what is "primarily intended" for commercial purposes is somewhat hazy, but if you are not making more money than it costs to run the site, etc. (factoring in non-cash costs like your time as well), you are likely acting within the license. Making money is not completely forbidden by the license, but using the work primarily to do so.
Do you mean Che Guevara, the Cuban revolutionary leader?Well, let's quote Che. He once wrote "you can kill a man, but you cannot kill an idea". He was writing about how the idea of freedom from oppression is catching, and will spread regardless of attempts to stamp it out.There is still oppression in the world. There is still a thirst for freedom from it. So why not? The same basic conditions apply as when Che was alive.
There are many types of abuse mental, physical, neglect, Maybe she just doesn't want you around anymore. Perhaps it is pay back for something you did, and she just can't get over what  you  did to her. This restraining order can be a piece of mind,"If he is not around me, he can't hurt me anymore."  It may provide a safe area for the heart to rest easier. "If I don't see him, then I don't have to be reminded of how he has lied, cheated, let me down, whatever the case is".
Forgive any rambling, Im going to ensure I hit the 500 word limit. With the exception of the moon where the dirt bike is amazing to rack up coins with flips and crazy air time, the race car is the superior vehicle. On maps like the beach and the cave the down force keeps you down on the big hills and keeps you in the ground. On Highway and Rollercoaster, forget about it, it's tailor made for those levels. I have made all of my high scores with the race car, on every map except the moon. Another huge downside of the bike is it's so flippy, if you get onto a hill and you lose momentum you end up doing a back flip and you slip backwards and can't get back up without a run up. With the race car, once you get forward momentum the downforce keeps your front end down and you will get up any hill. CMV!
I am just under the impression that a man's first love is his strongest love and every following love is a bit weaker each time.  ALSO each following love is trying to match the intensity of the first love, a bit like chasing the dragon after taking a drug for the first time.  I base much of my view on the belief that after separating from your first love the veil falls and your naive beliefs about love go away forever.  By this I mean that you no longer believe in the "fairy tale" love stories and start to see just how hurtful love can be.  Reddit change my view.
No. I wouldn't be able to turn them in. If you truly love someone you would do anything to help them. Especially if it was an accident.Though, if he killed some one just because he felt like killing somone it may be a little different, because I wouldnt want him to go nuts and kill me too.
Porn is definitely wrong. Porn is like an addiction to some people which is unhealthy and can lead to guilt and lust. An addiction to porn gives an unhealthy image of real sex. Porn promotes the fact that sex is totally based on pleasure, but it is actually based on love and affection also. Porn inspired numerous crimes that sometimes abuse the rights and virginity of many people.
I would rather have a lousy father than being fatherless because I would at least have the tranquility of knowing who my father is than spending my whole life wondering who he was. If I was to grow up fatherless I would grow with an emptiness in me. I would prefer growing up with a lousy father and learn from his mistakes than not having a father at all.
I think that TV is good because it is faster and some people cant read
Spanking should not be an option to discipline a child, parents have a lot other options before spanking. Its better to talk to them about what they did wrong and solve the problem in a proper way.
Yes definately i will turn him in to the police because he has commited a murder and its a sin. Maybe if he gets arrested,he can feel guilty for what he has done and try not to repeat it again. And also how can i trust a murderer?He can even be telling a lie to me and maybe can kill me for someone else in the future.so Just by confiding to me does not make him clean and innocent.
In order to help advance a common good, you must first realize what is your common good. You have to know when you are that better person to then spread your good to other people. You can't just assume that you are a great person if you don't have anything to show it. If you desire to see a world full of all this goodness, YOU have to be that spark that starts the fire.
At the moment, I would have to choose a Personal Pursuit, I have goals set and would like to have them accomplished before I can begin to help others. Although I do enjoy helping others, it is "I" who I must help first.
if your society systematically puts down or punishes a specific group of people on a racial basis then there is no difference between the two, because that kind of discrimination (jobs, schools, neighbourhoods) will lead to an increase in criminal behaviour....simply because there are fewer and fewer alternatives, if any, available.if white anglo-saxon protestants were systematically beaten down for generations, then they'd pretty much match the criminal profile.
Yes you do have officers out there that are racist. Its sad that you can not even trust the people out there that are supposed to protect you. But if you think about it, everyone is racist in their own little way. Some just do not even notice it. Racism is sad though and we should all look at each other the same way. People are kinda like crayons...They come in different shapes, sizes, and colors but we all still have to live in the same box
You know these cars with "systems." You hear the bass booming from hundreds of feet away. The vibrations shake your floors. If you can make out the music, it's usually terrible techno or hip-hop.These systems serve no purpose to the driver or the roads that they utilize. From a safety standpoint, the sound is a clear distraction that could mask an emergency vehicle siren, or passing car horn. From a quality of life standpoint, it's pure noise pollution, and a sign of pure inconsideration when a driver refuses to keep it down late at night.I feel the DMV should be performing a decibel check on all car audio systems, and they should not exceed the maximum of the car's horn. Massive stereo hardware should not be considered street legal. Reject their inspection, and impound them if discovered on the road.
I think it depends on how the rich made their money. Some rich people came across their money honestly. They should be left alone. However, alot of rich people have come across significant portions of their money through dishonest means...by hiring 'illegal alien' workers who work for maybe $1-2 per hour instead of hiring a legal worker who they'd be required to pay minum wage (Wal-Mart has been found guilty of this several times over the past years especially in hiring their janitorial staffs), by cheating on their tax returns, by pulling other accounting fiascos (just look at Enron), etc. Any rich person who has come across money through dishonest means...I'd say steal it all and give it to the poor because that's likely who they were taking that money from.
No you can't.You can claim to know someone inside and out and even be soulmates for just shy of a lifetime, but with each new day, minute, and second of life, you are learning new things about someone that would make you shocked to know.Proof of this: Crimes, divorce, arguments, deep conversations, expressions, employment terminations, etc.Deep down, everyone has something that is eventually revealed into the world that not a person knows or knew about prior.With that, you can NEVER truly know what makes a person tick.
I have to contradict phro and say that the peppered moths do show evidence of evolution. The data may have been insufficient, but evolution did occur.When different alleles are expressed due to external factors, this is evolution.
yes, the two women have separate issues going on. This is perfectly legal and moral. Your ex-wife is going to court concerning you.  The new wife is going to court concerning her husband. This has nothing to do with you. The only conflict there would be, was if the ex-wife and you had the same lawyer. Obviously that can not work. You need someone looking out for your interest and she needs someone looking out for hers. As long as you didn't cheat on the ex with the new, because then the new girlfriend would probably be named in the divorce case.
emergency petitons for psychiatric evaluations are NOT an arrest.. nor are they availible for review by an employer.. the American Disablities Act prevents this.. and gives you ground for a law suit if it is used against you.. you do need to make your employer aware of your conditon.. if he fires you.. you will file a claim with the ADA.. chances are they will deny your claim if you didnt make them aware of your illness prior to employment.. after the ADA reviews this .. you will be given a "right to sue" letter.. (whether the ADA find validity in your claim or not-- you still have to go through this) only after the proceedings with the ADA can you get a lawyer involved.. he will argue that you didnt make your employer aware of your illness prior to employment because they would have not hired you in the first place.. many lawyers work probono and have a field day with employers like these.. bottom line.. mental illnesses such as Bipolar.. are a disabilty furthermore.. you may also be eligible for Social Security.. so you dont have to put up with narrowminded employers..
This is maybe more specific to Canada, but I really don't care which candidate wins what or what party they belong to. I feel like regardless if it's the Liberals, Conservatives, or NDP (read: the parties that could realistically win just about everything), some good things will get done, more bad things will be done, there's a 25% chance of some major scandal, and there will definitely be corruption. And then there's the fact that every incumbent cancels out what their predecessors put in place to put their own mark on things and this just continues in a cycle. This is me looking at the situation without my own political beliefs. For example, if I am in favour of subways and only party X is, I am not taking that into account.
As an academic definition it makes sense- some people benefit from characteristics they are born with based on historical and present discrimination- but it seems like wherever it's used outside sociological theory it instead is an excuse to simply dismiss the arguments of those you disagree with.E.g., "You're privileged, so your opinion on this issue is invalid"I feel like using privilege in any kind of discussion is just an indirect way of arguing ad hominem, rather than actually engaging the other person in a reasonable debate. Even if someone's opinions really are biased due to their differing experiences caused by social privilege, I don't think that pointing out that privilege is at all a valid way to prove them wrong.
Now I know this sounds messed up, but I do not believe that donating free rice to a third world country is a good idea. Although it sounds good in the short term, less starvation, it ultimately just temporarily hids a problem. When a third world nation is supplied with free food it can distribute to its people any form of farming or other food production of that country suffers. If a farmer is producing rice and selling it in said country, their livelihood will be ruined by rice which is freely available to the population. If any kind of donations are made, it should be money. This money could be used to subsidize farmers of the third world countries which would allow cheaper food prices, greater food production, and more employment opportunities from the larger food industry of these countries.
This group uses violence to spread their message and intimidate people with fear.By starting fires in civilian areas, the group fits the definition of terrorists. As noted in the news article, the fires targeted forest ranger stations, meat packing plants, wild horse corrals, lumber mill offices, research facilities, an SUV dealer and, in 1998, Vail Ski Resort.We cannot limit our concept of terrorist to Islamic radicals. Anyone striking civilian targets with violence with the intent to send a message or spread fear should be considered a terrorist organization.
Just like any other private schools, religious schools earn money from their own pupils money which goes DIRECTLY to THEM and is not subsidised in any way unlike public schools who have to use community fundraisers and events.The money given to private instituations like these is like giving money to a stranger and asking that they give it to charity... you do not know what they are going to do with it and how it will benefit their students.
I think both being fatherless and having lousy father is depressing. But for me i will prefer to be fatherless, because at least you know that being fatherless is a good reason for a father not to be around. It would hurt me the most if i had a lousy father and not to care about me. In this case i am in the middle of this two choices, that is because i have a father but he is not here in this country, i understand him because he left back to our country for a great reason. But i still need him here to support me.
I try to see things in both ways, but even though sometimes Ill rather have a fatherless father I think having a lousy father would be better for me because in order to grow up and be ready for life you have to learn about life and if you do not have an image or person to look up life could become harder or not good.
Bottled water consumption has grown exponentially over the past ten to fifteen years. This growth has taken place globally, but particularly in Europe and North America. The bottled water industry has literally created its own water culture which is good for american industries.
I think that focusing on a personal persuit comes first, going to college, having a career, and reaching a position of power. I don't think there really is a day when you will announce to the world that your going to advance the common good, but you can help people here and there, donating a little bit of time, donating a little money, but in the end if your ever in the position of power and have money you could truly advance the common good.
Being in the police academy is very intensive and can even be quite stressful.  Were you being supportive when he was there?  I don't want to be disrespectful to you, but it sounds like you may have been the one being selfish.  Were you being super demanding on him then? Maybe I'm missing part of the story.You should be happy that he was bettering himself and furthering his career.  I'd say if that was the only issue that caused your break-up, then yes, get back with him.
the sheriffs department do not have salesthey are not in the business of being creditors/ liquidators/ repossesors, salesman. Thry are bluffing you ( harrasement), they are laws on this. When a deby get dues to expire collection agencies get real aggressive on collection. The only thing a sherrifs department can do is allow a party to collect cars.. ect.. ( not sure about furniture ), or ensure a safe and legal eviction.
After listening to CGP Grey and Brady Haran on their podcast, I had to agree with Grey that news websites and television channels have become redundant for anyone seeking important information on current affairs.Most news either does not effect my life or will be forgotten or irrelevant in a matter of months.I am not saying that they are pointless, as people enjoy watching or reading news, but as a source for up-to-date, interesting and well researched information, there are enough specialist sources for a deeper critique or explanation to current affairs, and twitter/reddit keep me informed with anything that is particularly salient.I've deleted the BBC, HuffPost and CNN apps from my phone, I can get current affairs from Twitter. Any takers, CMV?Edit: I am not questioning the importance of journalism. It is my position in the news chain. Why read the paper or watch the news when I can find out what is important from trusted people and then read myself, rather than sift through headlines.
The smaller the body politic, the more the people are in control. The best size political unit is the city: big enough to have the advantages of scale (pooling risk, working together on public projects), small enough to avoid the disadvantages (corruption of big money, large inefficient bureaucracy). Look at how well governed Norway is with 5 million people. Look how badly China is governed with 1,351 million. I say the reason is that larger groups are harder to govern with good ideals. We should invoke Article V of the Constitution and partition the US into several independent countries, for instance: Cascadia, Texas, California, Heartland, New England, Florida, and the Confederacy. These could be linked together with trade and mutual defense deals the way Europe is.
This place's idea about individual portions is pretty awesome. There is definitely more attention paid to the actual food than you would have in other buffets. Service was nice, although it became a bit of a "Where's Waldo" when we wanted to ask for some Sprite later on in the meal. New York Steak was really good for a buffet and I really enjoyed the miso shrimp salad. I want to come back to try for dinner, as we came during brunch!
Raising Cane's is a yummy choice for chicken tenders and fries. Their dipping sauce is delicious. And, as a bonus, you get a piece of toast and/or cole slaw (depending which size meal you opt for). Personally, I always get the 3 finger combo (3 pieces of chicken, fries, and toast) as it is more than big enough to more than fill me up. It's a little pricier than I would have expected, but it's reasonable for the quality and quantity. The staff are pleasant and speedy at this location. The drive-thru is usually always a breeze. All in all, a good fast food spot for lunch or dinner.
Pizza was okay. $9.99 for a medium pizza. When you pay they swing the touch screen display around so you can pay after they swipe your card which displays your order total and if you want to leave a tip. You have to hit no for the tip and sign. I would think that for to go orders would not ask for a tip at all. They did not have any menu's you had to look on their wall that had the menu displayed in chalk. Said pizza would take about 9 minutes and ended up being 28 minutes. This is a new place and their sanitation score was a 97.5.
The school my mother works at, plus the school district my cousin's 3 children are in, are utilizing school uniforms. One reason is to "reduce bullying", which in reality, doesn't even address the problem concerning bullying. The only good it does is that it gets rid of or reduces students being bullied because they aren't wearing a specific clothing label that they dictate is the IN thing to wear. While it's a problem, all it does is sweep the one basic type of bullying under the rug. Kids will find other reasons to bully others. It also infringes upon their basic rights to be individuals and to express their individuality.
I think if i had a dad that did nothing for me i wouldnt want him around because odds are you and him arent going to be talking 5 years down the line anyway, so why try and make it work out if you already know what the outcome is.
I think it's better to have a lousy father than to be fatherless because, growing up without a father can be hard for some kids. For example, there are some children that need dads to teach them right from wrong, but as long as you have a father no matter how lousy he is, at least you have somebody their to support your decisions and encourage you.
Yes I do feel that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere unless in the case of emergency. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time. Water bottles also are almost never recycled, and end up in landfills which lead to pollution of our environment. They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself... The water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria anyway.
The dismissal in fact leaves open the possibility of re-filing the lawsuit or otherwise attempting to collect the claimed debt."Without prjeudice" means that the case was not adjudicated and no resoltuion has been made.However, at this point you have grounds for a counter-action if they continue to pursue this claim, or make harmful statements to credit reporting agencies.You can ask an attorney to help with a formal letter to the company advising them that you will take such action.  You should include copies of any derogatory material on any credit reports, and demand that these be corrected.  Separately, you should also notify the credit reporting agencies that the report is incorrect and demand a change.In this manner you protect your intersts - and, if the company is fool enough to try again, you are positioned to sue them in return and make a wad.
Technically IC Systems is liable, but you'd probably have to go to small claims court to make them cough up.  My advice to you is to change your bank account number right away so they can't dip into it any time they like.  (This is the only dependable way to stop unwanted ACH transfers once you have given your permission for the withdrawal.)  Then set up other payment arrangements with them.  While you're doing that, you should tell them you're reducing the amount you owe by the $120 in fees they cost you.  Put that in a letter to them, and pay the account down until there is only $120 left.  Then stop paying.  If they continue to come after you, refer to the letter and point out that you have a legitimate dispute.
If daughter was 19, and competent at the time, then all records are hers, nobody elses. Depending on how much time has passed the document holders could be charged with theft. If years have passed, and the daughter hasn't made previous attempts to claim the documents, then they will be assumed to be the holders documents. You need a lawyer involved.
Do you mean "employee"? And what's "unfair dismissal"? In most states, employment is at-will, that means an employer can dismiss an employee at anytime for any reason or no reason at all.  Just because you don't like the reason they gave doesn'tmean you have an action against them for firing you.However, there are restrictions.  Employees cannot be fired because they are a member of a protected class (i.e. age, race, gender, disability).  They cannot be fired, for example, if they were whisleblowers in most states.  SEEK ATTORNEY ADVICE to see if you have an employment discrimination or unlawful termination claim. Most plaintiffs' lawyers who handle employment work will have an initial consultation with you for free and will take your case on a "Contigency" so you don't have to pay for legal fees unless you win your case.  Contact your local bar association for a reference.
Once upon a time, paper checks were a practical, easy way to transfer money from a checking account to another account. However, with today's technology (debit cards), the need for them has disappeared.Direct deposit is paperless removes the need for paper checks for employers to pay their employees.Outside of the workplace, the only people who seem to pay with paper checks are older people, who seem to not have a problem with paper checks and have no reason to adapt, even though it causes an inconvenience to people waiting in line behind them.CMV
We came to this buffet after a show in the casino. The hostesses were not very friendly, but it was busy so we assumed it was because of that. The buffet and restaurant itself is very nice and clean but the food was very average. The food quality was not what I was expecting for the $70+ price tag that we paid as a couple. Next time we are in Vegas we will try another place.
If my wife confided in me than I wouldn't betray her trust. She trusted me to support and help her and I would. I would be extremely angry and maybe even divorce her depending on what type of murder whether it be like a self defence murder or she just thought it would be fun.
Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have from him are his absence, and not knowing what he was like. A lousy father could come in gain your trust, and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. To me having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence because either way he knows nothing about you, and you nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.
I believe that everyone has a right to be happy. I have two best friends who are gay, one is female and the other is male. I have no problem being around them as well as when they are with their partners. I believe that gay people have every right to get married just as I had the right to get married to my husband. EVERYONE has the right to love who they want to love and even if they are gay they should be able to get married just like people who are straight.
Personal pursuit is better in my opinion. How are you going to reach common good if you cant better yourself. People may see that as being selfish but you cant help others if you cant help yourself.
I'm having a hard time believing you actually got fined for tossing a butt out of your window, unless your area has a risk of forest fire then I could understand.  Your best bet is to take it to court and try to discredit the officer's observation.  Was it raining, foggy, was he parked off on the side of the road behind some foliage?  Were there other cars on the road with you that could have thrown the cigarette out onto the road? The main question you want to ask is "Can he reasonably prove that it was your cigarette?"  If you think that you can win the case then by all means try, that is what makes our legal system so great.  The only problem is that you may lose the trial and then have to pay your fine, plus court fees.
Seek legal advice. I mean if your gonna loose your job anyway and maybe your home for lack of money. What have you got to loose? Your kids could starve you could loose everything you own. Do something before that happens. They company will be heartbroken I'm sure!!!!!!  Most of them couldn't care less about there people, and will try to get you to quit or mess up so they can terminate your employment. Seen it to many times. Just ask a lawyer about you case, they don't have to know you asked them. The lawyer will tell you if you even have a chance. Won't cost to ask!
i dont understand how in the world he took the kids away from their mother...that is something that is extremly hard to do in the courts...but i think that if she wants her family back that bad and feels like if she dont have her family back that theirs no meaning in her life then support her but also remind her to becareful and try to save some money on the side for herself just incase...maybe he really does love her and realized that the grass wasnt greener on the otherside and now he wants his old happy life back....just try and help her secretly save some money as a just incase fund....i wish your sister the best
Suppose our species was wiped off the face of the earth. What better tool could aliens possibly use to gain better insight about mankind? Wikipedia may not be 100% reliable, but it offers a general explanation to almost all of human (and earth's) history. No other resource ever created offers more information about us as a species. In my opinion, this is the single greatest collaboration of information that mankind has collectively put together. Some may argue that the internet as a whole clearly trumps a single source. So for the sake of my argument I would like to keep this discussion limited to one single resource.  CMV
Im Gonna say the Machines, Simply cause it doesent matter which kind of Machine were talking about either terminator or like "i robot" they are not easy to kill. Zombies its 1 shot to the head or taking the head off and its game over. Plus Machines Can Controle other Machines Like cars, supercomputers, Cell phones and a whole citys power sorce and plus military weapons like Jets and tanks etc. and once they get ahold of guns and such were gonna have a HUGE WAR on our Hands
If my wife was to commit murder and told me about it. I wouldnt turn her in because if you really love her then you would have her back through anything good or bad.
I would rather be father less it might sound bad but I dont want to think of my father as a lousy one. I would love my dad but it just wouldn't be the same if you had a bad father that just keep bringing you problems. You dont have to have a father you can talk to someone else. Maybe its just because I am girl it would be easier for me to talk to my mother.
Banning bottled water would hurt the economy because it would leave hundreds of people without jobs and the big corporations like Dasani and Nestle would loose millions of dollars. It would hurt the economy severely. Millions of Americans use and purchase water bottle everyday so, banning them would only hurt big corporations.http://www.nestlewaterscorporate.com/bottled_water_things_to_know/
As an ambitious, young person wanting to become a lawful, successful, homicide detective, I would not be lenient with any murderer in my midst.Hopefully, the murder wouldn't be the result of a pleasure/malicious-kill, so that the sentencing won't be as harsh, but nonetheless, all murderers must be tried. After all, hopefully my spouse will understand that having to live in hiding is basically the same as being in prison except much worse since there would be little chance for parole since they will have to live with the guilt and/or the fear of being caught for the rest of their lives.
Were YOU eligible for unemployment?  If not then you've commited FRAUD.  This can be a felony in most states.  I'd try and get it straightened out before they come after you.  They will notice this and catch on to it.  Today in most states employeers have to report new employees to the state because of child support laws.  This will be a way for them to catch you.  The other main way is with your taxes.  When you file they will notice the W-2s filed in your husbands and/or your name.
I think we should put research into shooting large amounts of trash into the sun, or space in general.. It would disintegrate before it even arrived at the sun.. Perhaps we would be able to do it once or twice a year where we could be certain it would land. But maybe we should just fire it into the vast openness of space. Scale wise, it is highly unlikely it would ever hit anything within several hundred years. We just need to shoot it with enough power to reach Earths escape velocity, and in some sturdy container that wouldnt burn up as it left our atmosphere.
I personally feel that the amount of money they're being paid is too much. Now I'm not trying to be the one to say this from a jealous standpoint because I don't get paid enough from my job. I'm not saying it isn't fair they're paid as much as they are. I'm saying that I think they should be paid a comfortable salary for a nice home and not have to worry about bills and such. But, they shouldn't be paid such gross amounts when that money could be recirculated to help the economy or other critical areas of our nation instead of just hoarding all of it.Yes, this may sound stupid, but I'd really like some insight as to why sports players deserve the amount of money they're given.EDIT: Thank you to /u/081613 and /u/Osric250 for changing my view.
First, let me admit my bias: my USA team's strongest competitor for the #2 Group G spot is Ghana, a head-to-head conquest.That said, sports are played to be won, not to have a lot of points scored, and this is especially true of soccer. I'll give goal difference its due, because it measures the strength of the team over the entire tournament, but goals scored is almost randomly decided, and certainly privileges certain styles of play. It's absurd to me to think that Team A can be passed over for Team B, given identical records and a head-to-head loss, because Team B had an additional goal, with all its attendant factors (only one of which is team strength).EDIT: Let me make myself more clear. The first tiebreaker in group play is goal differential/goal difference. That is right and proper. Then comes goals scored, *then* the head-to-head results between teams. I think the order of the latter two should be reversed.
I am freaking obsessed with this place! Every time my husband and I go there, we wonder why we haven't been back sooner. We tend to forget about it a little bit because it's nothing flashy, but the food never disappoints.  Chicken. On point. Beef. On fleek. Rice, beans, PLANTAINS? God, stop it.So good.  My only disappointment was that I tried dessert and had what I thought was a tres leches cake and it didn't taste like what I thought it would? Maybe I'm used to an over sugarized Amercian version of it :)
A father is someone is always their for you. He's the one that teaches you how to throw a baseball, and comes to all of you baseball games. A father is someone that protects you from all the evils of the world. But if our father is someone that doesn't care about you and spends most of his time in his room, then how can you trust that man to protect you. A lousy father is someone that is someone that you have a hard time trusting. I would rather have no father, then a father that I cant even trust my life with.
I believe that both are bad but I would rather go fatherless. What is the point of having someone in your life that is lousy? A father should set a good example for their children. If the dad is lousy then he is teaching his kids that it is okay to be that way and not do anything with their life. If I got married and my husband was a lousy father, I would tell him he better step up and be the dad I know he can be or get out the house a never come back.
I think it would be better to have a lousy father because atleast you have someone there. Just because a father is lousy doesn't mean you can't change that. Maybe you could knock some sense into him and he would come around and be a good father. The fact that you would never even get a chance to know your father makes me believe that having a lousy father is better than no father.
We've all heard the saying "don't believe everything you see on the internet", which assumes that information gathered from other sources not online have a natural higher level of credibility. They assume that information found in books or news channels or newspaper are more truthful. I disagree. I'm a true neutralist who believes that just because a propagandist had the money to spend to distribute their information through a book or a newspaper article, it doesn't give it any more credibility than typical things we see online. We should obviously look at everything with an open mind and try to figure out what is truth and what isn't, I just don't believe in that idea.Edit: I understand the point of having someone to hold accountable in the case of spreading disinformation. That is a great point. I guess I asked the wrong question though because obviously, statistically, there will be more lies seen online than in publications just because it's easier to spread. Thanks for the posts.
I can easily guarantee that most people who say this have a very weak knowledge or understanding of American history. Moreover, it is impossible to make a judgment, especially such an extravagant one, on a leader who has not even finished their term yet. People fail to look at history objectively and only assess it in the context of their own generation. I'm not a fan of Obama at all, but I can reassure you, we've had at least 5-10 leaders who were much worse than Obama is.
"Finally, more people have died at the hands of secular governments than any form of religious "war" in history."The raw number of people killed is not a fair measure of "badness." The population is always increasing, therefore religious wars that killed half of a certain group of people a thousand years ago might not reach the same *number* of people killed in a modern day war, even though the devastation wrought by the religious war was far worse than that of the modern war.A better measure would be some sort of "misery index." It would take into account the chances of a person born at a certain time and place either dying or living a miserable life. Certainly religion has a long record of causing misery, keeping people poor, and killing large percentages of unbelievers.
This place is bad. We walk in and no one acknowledges us for over 5 min, but employees stared at us and knew we were there. Finally they told us it would be a 10 min wait. We waited a few min and then they said it was going to be a 15 min wait. There were plenty of seats open too. Very poor people skills, including what looked to be a young lady Mgr.
Really really good! If I'm in the area and in the mood for Korean BBQ, I'll be here. This is one of my favorite Korean BBQ eateries next to Gen and Hwaro. We always get the marinated beef and marinated boneless ribs. Beef brisket is good too and there are a lot of sides! Also the steamed egg is always good when cooled down. I just wish this place has gyoza or other appetizers but in all, I'll keep coming back here. If my friends have extra room in their stomachs, we end up going to Rolled Ice Cream after!
After a year i have yet to be disappointed by the quality of food and the excellent service at The Zen. Since my last review i have tried many different foods and always find them being my favorite compared to anywhere else.Every time i go here i am greeted by courteous employees and they remember me every time. I have had nice conversations with Steven (hope that's correct spelling), begging him to open a store in Peterborough so i can enjoy the food more often. Some of the foods i would recommend are the Chicken Pakora, any of the Pad Thai, Manchurian Chicken Fried Rice and the Goat Curry. There are so many other delicious selections though.If you are looking for something different or just looking for a new spot to eat i highly recommend The Zen.
books is well better than tv because it is cheaper to buy a bookif you wanted to buy a tv it would be really dear and you have to buy a tv licencebooks can help you learna lot of the stuff on tv is either violent or not right for kidsso books are well better
1. It makes everyone equal - if children can wear what they want some children will teased and feel less equal to their peers around them vs. uniforms2. Okay Look school is for learning not how you look and dress but maybe in some levels it matters and most people that go to schools that don't have uniforms take like about 1 hr just to find their pants or shirt I mean really?? When you have a uniform it takes less than 10 min just to take it out and put it on and
a good proposal for an amendment for the Constitution would be  to change the requirements to be president.  you would still have to be 35 years old and be a resident in the United States for 14 years, but change the natural-born citizen part.  instead of being a natural-born citizen make it be a United States citizen for 40 years.  this way people whose parents move here when they are kids; these would be the only ways that they know and know as much as any other kid here.  i think this would be a grand topic to talk about in your paper and could easly elaberate on with examples.  remember to explain yourself and put your heart and soul into it to get a good grade.
Your odds are not good getting beyond his limits. Your attorney might sue him, but it is doubtful you would be able to collect much. Even if you won a case you would have to go after him for garnishments,etc.. If he doesn't own a paid home or other material goods the attorney probably won't bother. He may look at your personal auto insurance. That will usually cover for uninsured motorists if you carry that coverage but he would have to determine of you could use it since you weren't driving at the time. Since you say you have $170000 in medical bills I am guessing you don't have any personal medical insurance either. Your attorney should be able to tell you what to expect to receive after his fee, which is usually 25% to 40% depending.
No.Any society that values the value of a human life and promotes non-violent solutions would be hypocritical to include floogging and capital punishment in their justice system.With a fallible justice system, there is always the risk that innocent people will be flogged or executed.Where punnishments are decided by mortals, there is a risk that the harsher sentences are handed out according to prejudice.Where the best barristers are available to those with the most money, there is always a risk that the poor are disadvantaged.
My school has a policy where if there is a bomb threat the entire school must pile up in our stadium and wait out until police and a bomb squad come. However a smart terrorist (or whomever) could easily find this out (every school does the same and says it on our website) and plant a bomb in said stadium killing the entire student body and staff. It would make more sense for me to just run to my car (off campus) and escape. Its worth saving my life 100% of the time. Our school tells us whether or not we have a drill that day or not so I would know if its a legitimate threat. CMV.
You can actually see evolution happen. Fruit Flies are quite useful for this experiment since the breed, live, and die so quickly. You have to understand evolution happens because of mutations and they survive because those mutations have made it easier for the creature to survive then the others. ie. natural selection. Speciation is also an example of evolution... different species come about because they have adapted to a slightly different enviroment. If you look you can see evolution
After a spanking I made sure I never did it again to avoid being punished because the second time is always worst because you were told not to already.
does this make sense: you steal a candy bar from school then your parents steal your favorite toy. you stole something and were disciplined by getting something stolen. hm. same thing applies to this. you hit somebody then you get hit. you get told not to hit somebody, then told not to hit, then hit by the saame person
some children simply cannot take pe. 4 example some r already in athletics and they are alreaddy training like crazy
I'm not quite sure I understand the question. Petitions, in and of themselves, are legal. You can make a petition concerning almost anything, and get a bunch of people willing to sign their names to it, via email or otherwise. However, a petition itself is not an actual "legal document"...it is merely a document stating that X number of citizens happen to take a stand on a particular issue and urge a legislator, official, etc. to act in their favor. For example, you can make a petition in favor of banning smoking, but just because you get a bunch of people to sign it, that doesn't mean that smoking will be banned. The petition itself has no legal standing. Now, if a legislator gets enough petitions all saying the same thing, he/she might WANT to do it if it is in his/her best political interest to do so. So the answer to your question is yes.Hope this helped somewhat.
It is Very difficult to get Sole custody. You have to PROVE that the mother is unfit and is harming your child in some way. Being in jail sounds bad but since she is in jail she can not be doing anything harmful. (In the courts point of view) Fighting this will be tough. You would be better off trying to change visitation. Try to get it that it has to be supervised. I would go talk to a lawyer. The first consultation is usually free. (and custody battles can be expensive)
Im a sorry to hear about your tragedy. It sure sounds like your neighbor's son has a serious problem that requires immediate attention. Depending on the mental status of that nine year old, the courts should be able to do something to compensate you for the damage. If he is evaluated by a professional and the results come back normal, you can charge for simple assoult. If not, you can still charge because ultimately, the parents of an ill child are responsable for any intentional damages caused by him. I suggest you speak with the chief of your police station, explain to him what happened and what you want done. If this doesnt help, go a step further up the ladder until you resolve the problem. Bulling has no excuse. Best wishes.
I'll add some arguments here, but please don't feel obligated to address them point by point. There's plenty of stuff I've probably missed/gotten1. With the advent of Constantly Variable transmissions that shift gears more efficiently than humans, stick shifts - even well driven ones - no longer have the potential to give better fuel economy. 2. The chance of a manual stalling on a busy road is a very real threat to public safety.3. The frequency of replacing a broken clutch is higher than repairing automatic gearboxes, negating the cheaper cost of manual cars over the long term.4. They are a liability trying to start on uphill roads. 5. They are generally far noisier in urban areas due to the average driver's reluctance to shift up gears on short streets or journeys. 6. They divert the driver's attention away from the road as they focus on selecting the optimal gear. 7. I cannot eat a cheeseburger while driving. Please CMV.
I am generally against the use of the death penalty on moral reasons for practically every reason other than crimes against humanity, as I think killing another person is an issue that concerns humanity in general. I don't think it has moral use for other heinous crimes such as murder or rape in practically every circumstance. I can see why people here have the opposite opinion and so I'm willing to change my mind. I'm hoping to hear something new though, and not just an argument saying how bad some examples are.Edit: My moral reasons rest in the fact that killing a person is against humanity. Therefore capital punishment should be used for something that goes against humanity itself.
Opera is great. It has all the best features of the browsers, but it has the least recognition. Take "Speed dial" for example. It puts your 9 most used bookmarks in the screen when you create a blank tab. It also has many add ons, but it's community is just beginning. Also, it was recentlly rated very highly in CPU magazine, with its only flaw being it's lack of add ons, which is greatly increasing. Opera will be releasing a new version of the browser; 9.52, which will have many enhancements, including speedier performance than any of it's competitors. In fact, Opera is so good that until recently, people were willing to pay for it.
Education should be free because it is one of the key ways to decrease poverty. If education was forced to have fees the people in poverty would not by able to afford it. This would cripple the poor and put us in a society where only the middle class and rich prosper. (it's bad enough as it is). The people in poverty will never learn how to prevent diseases which plague their society, nor other resources to help them live better lives. As a society we should want to help those who are less fortunate.
Very cool topic.Yeah I think it could reasonably happen. I mean just look at the reactions around the world to incidents in one country and the ripple effect it has.When Tianamen Square happened there was a reaction all over the world. There were not mass riots but there were really strong opinions in every major country and lots of news reports.The world is too open now to try to hide incidents like these.I can really see how it might happen.
I think it is better to be fatherless because a lousy father cannot do anything for the family.Imagine a father who is alcoholic and beats your mother, then you have no meaning of having a father.He creates violance and terror in the house and you alawys feel ashame to call him a father. It is better to be fatherless than to have a father who gives you a hard time.
Some kids don't learn by spanking them..So why waste your time on that, when you can always take something valuable away from them.
I would turn him in becasue it is wrong for any reason to kill someone. If he can kill one person what says that he will not kill me? Everyone wants to know what happened to their loved ones and that would give them the peace that the person that did it was paying for what he did. Love is not worth the risk of you getting caught for not telling what you know.
In this situation it depends whether you knew the victim or if it was a stranger. If my husband killed a random stranger, then YES I would definitely turn him in because that considers him a psycho and what if he kills me too. But if he killed a person that I knew and that was harming us then I would think about it. It's most likely that I would turn him in just because I would be afraid to leave with a person like that, and also what if he thinks I will say something and kills me too.
The person above is absolutely wrong.  Property is property.  He will own it as long as he is able to pay taxes and the mortgage.  His business will remain his business as long as he can run it. He and only he will decide if he wants to sell his house or his business, the government can't take it away just because he is here illegally.But he could get in trouble with the IRS if he doesn't pay taxes, but that has nothing to do with his immigration status whatsoever.  It is not true that a person here illegally cannot pay property and business taxes.  The IRS has the same authority over any citizen or non-citizen that does not pay all the business taxes.  So tell him not to worry about the government, just make enough money to pay the bills.
It's not the reaction times -- it's the crime itself you're punished for.Driving while intoxicated is a special case because there are special laws regulating alcholol and other intoxicant. But while it's easy to test for drug/alcohol use in an objective blood test, it's almost impossible to test for emotional or situational impairments.So, driving while intoxicated can be punished by itself, separately, because there can be objective standards. But anything else can only be punished based on the objective results.
I booked flights with Malaysia Airlines from Dublin to Hong Kong (via Heathrow and Kuala Lumpur) around 2 hours before the MH17 crash. Yesterday I received an email from the airline, offering a full refund up until 24th July, or offering to change bookings to a later date. I now have doubts about the safety record of the airline, even though it appears that there was nothing that could have been done to prevent the latest tragedy. The fate of flight MH370 remains unsolved, and declining consumer confidence appears to be reflected in the Malaysian stock market, which has experienced overall growth of 80% in the past five years while Malaysian Airlines stock price has fallen by the same figure. In light of this, I'm seriously considering taking them up on their offer of a refund. CMV
I would say before.......I have never been married but have been with someone long enough to be commonlaw so I will consider it the same thing.As far as sex comes it was much better earlier in relationships before marriage/long term commitment.It seems when your new all your hormones are racing and you feel the excitement of being with someone new/ different. After a long time having sex with the same person the quanity and quality both began to subside.It seems after a long time it seems like a routine with less experimentation same positions, same girl, same everything....I find the excitement of having sex with someone much better, constantly being turned on not being able to keep your hands off eachother.
Last second find...Not what expected in a grand way! Who knew?? Sushi was on point delicious and fresh for our group of 10. Service was spot on. Proximity to the action of Vegas inside & out. Worth a stop in for dinner and a show for sure. Gotta pay to play my friends and this joint is worth your dime. Cheers
No. I would not turn my spouse in. I would try to convince him to do the right thing and turn his own self in. But i dont see it as my place to go and turn him in. but it also depends on the reason behind him killing someone. it just cant be some random killing because i would turn him in for that for the fact that i would think that i would be next to get killed.
Love is much greater then any mistake. I know things happen but my wife will be able to confide in me no matter what goes wrong. I made a commitment to stay whit her through rough times and I will. Murder is a unforgivable mistake but love is not.
I would not turn him in unless he killed a more than one because there is no way it could be an accident more than once. I think if i loved the person enough i could hide the facts and act like it never happened.
People who are against tv keep on saying that it causes obesity.I'm not going to go for a run and bring a book to read on the way. I think it is much easier to exercise watching tv then reading a book.In gyms people do not have books infront of them, instead they have telvisions.Studies have shown that telivision is even more stimulating than books.
Parents should use spanking as an option to discipline only when it's needed. If the child doesn't follow the correct behavior that they should follow after several times being warned, then that is when the child deserves a spanking.
I support this because... I got spanked and I turned out to be a good daughter ..spanking teaches you not to do it again and be scared of doing it again.
I just don't think its worth it to spend a lifetime of hardship and fear in the real world, constantly wondering when would all come to an end.I'd rather have a normal life inside the simulation, and of course it could be a terrible and rough lfe, but it could also be a happy life, something that would be very difficult to achieve in the real world.In the end, we are nothing but souls connected to a life support system (the body). If my soul can achieve happiness through artificial stimulus to my brain rather than "real" experiencess, so be it.
I believe businesses shouldn't (but not to the extent of enforcing it by law*) give discounts to senior citizens and armed forces.Forgive me for saying, but does reaching the arbitrary number of 65 and serving a tougher by nature job entitle you to get a discount at the movies and at a restaurant?  Is it just as a way to say thanks?Armed forces seem to already get thanks with tax free goods on base.Senior citizens these days that are retiring are already reaping the benefits of social security, medicare, and hefty retirement funds because the benefits of being in the Baby Boomer generation.There are many tough professions out there that bring lots of value to the table that are tough but don't get discounts.  What about farmers?  They feed us right?  Doctors?  They keep us healthy.  Scientists?  Their discoveries and innovations improve the quality of our every day lives.
A long while ago Putin ordered all his government officials to close offshore accounts. He ordered all government officials to buy Russian made cars. And wealthy Russians use other countries to skate around Russian taxes. Now the US and EU are sanctioning business and people (I try to keep up on all the sanctions but I lose track). Europe buys from Russia much needed gas, and in turn, Russia buys things from Europe. They have a nice little ecosystem. So I believe, not only will this hurt Europe more so in the long run, but help Russia. Because Putin may use this to reign in his corrupt officials and tax skating billionaires. Don't rely on overseas business and don't use tax havens, because they will get sanctioned or frozen. This is just my opinion, or view. I'd like to hear others. Thanks.
I always hear about how if only we as a society would ignore WBC they'd go away and dissolve. I don't believe this. They are going to be in our history books because, despite what people want, they have gained enough attention to be placed so. I'm in no way saying I agree with them. But one thing that's good about their existence is extremism. I believe we as a culture, nation, even the world, should study more on extremism. It pushes people to do the craziest shit and we seem to get blindsided all the time by extremists. Why not analyze what these people believe and learn what makes them tick so we can learn from them? They believe in their minds they're right and we as a society are wrong. If we study the extremes, we can take better care of ourselves and watch out for the people who seem to win over nations, races, and society and cause them to do horrific things. So, change my view.
I think the recent feminist push (particularly #yesallwomen) in reaction to the shootings is taking away from the central point of despite Elliot Rodger being sexist, if mental health were a bigger issue and looked at more closely then the shooting potentially would not have happened. I'm all for feminism, do recognize that women face daily challenges men don't, and that there is a definitive misogyny in our culture, but taking a shooting that happened because of someone's mental health and spinning it for your own cause is unneeded and hurtful to the original problem. CMV.Edit: For clarification I don't think this is *soley* a mental health issue, or that sexism didn't play a part in what happened.Edit2: Thanks for the great discussion guys. It's very easy to feel "attacked" when you post threads like this but I haven't felt that way at all; I'd like to commend everyone on their ability to talk about differing view points and opinions instead of just arguing.
No I wouldn't tell on him because you never know what the reason might be for him to kill that person or it could have been for self defense for all we know and if the people come question me about anything I DON'T KNOW NOTHING.....he have my trust and I wouldn't let him down for no reason plus his secret is safe with me...
Even though Raffles sacked Farquhar when he came back to Singapore, this was because Farquhar was adopting measures that were not approved by Raffles. I believe Farquhar was adopting measures that were indirectly harmful to the population and Raffles sacked him for the best interests of Singapore's population at heart
Farquhar won the affection and respect from the people with his doings. When he was sacked, thousands of people bade him farewell on the day he left Singapore. This proves that Farquhar is very important to the people.
Science can prove that evolution is the beginning of life.The big bang theory is a term used to describe the bursting of molecules that begun the creation of the universe. The universe started out as a hot, dense space. Scientists know that because now nearby galaxies are moving further and further away and the universe is expanding and becoming cooler, so, in the past, the universe must have been hotter and more dense. Earth was the perfect candidate for life because it has the "Goldilocks" conditions. Bacteria started to form from molecules, which formed into fish, and then amphibians, then land animals, then monkeys, then humans.
A lousy father would be able to teach you more than no one at all. Maybe he will be able to teach what not to be like, how not to act, how not to treat your family. That is better than no teaching at all I think. He could toughen you up. Also you will at least know who he was and never wonder if your father was a saint or lousy, you already know.
Yes because that way the child can learn not to do it again because it really hurt, and i know this from experience.
Yes I believe you should spank a child only when they know they are wrong. The child will understand more if he is scared to do the same mistake. Actions speak louder than words.
I would say yes to some circumstances I would say yes but for others it would be a no I will not turn them in. I feel that if my spouse killed a person out of self defense or out of defense for another person then no I wouldn't turn them in. Another circumstance would be if they killed a person for killing someone or something like I that, then no I wouldn't turn them in. If they killed cold heartedly like rape, for money, objects and or just a pure disliking or a person then yes I would turn them in because someone that's that cold could kill me.
I think it's really two different questions, the letter of the law and the spirit of the law. Overwhelmingly Brown v. Board was successful in beginning the intergration of the whole of America, not just in education system, overturning the previous SCOTUS decision of "equal but seperate". However when you look at the spirit of the law, I believe it is still lacking, mostly due to geographic and monetary limitations. The disproportion in schools in wealthy, mostly suburban neighborhoods, to the poor mostly urban neighborhoods, is a problem we have yet to deal with. One could easily make an arguement that the system is now not seperate but still unequal due to the ability of communities to fund their local schools, not due to any prejudice.
Some people may be really bored in their classes because they aren't being challenged. Not every school has advanced classes either and I know my hs only had 3 AP classes. I think that schools should place students in classes based on their ability level. Instead of having someone fail a class, they can take a lower level class so they are actually learning and have a better change of comprehending what's going on. The students that are exceeding may be put in higher classes so they don't become bored with the curriculum. I don't mean that students should be put in different grades. I just feel that if they are not particularly good in one subject, they may need to go to an easier class.
I don't think you can make a statistical argument for the existence of aliens when you only have one example of a planet with life.If you had two examples in the Milky Way galaxy, for example, we could conclude that life probably evolves at least twice per galaxy. Or if we had an example from the nearest star with planets, we could conclude that probably every star with planets evolves life.But with just a single example, how do you possibly use that to estimate the distribution of life in the universe?  It could be once per universe, once per galaxy or once per 100 stars.  It would look the same.e: my point is not that life does not exist anywhere else.  My point is basically that I don't think you can estimate the probability at all.
A shotgun would need to be loaded and fired. A chainsaw is continuously running. Assuming the zombie population on this block is densely packed, I would pick the chainsaw.I'd go down the block while spinning in circle: a spinning circle of undead carnage.(Although if there is only a few zombies, the shotgun has the advantage of distance.)
Blackmail is where you offer NOT to reveal some embarassing or damaging piece of information for money or some act:obtaining or procuring something by illegal means, such as by force or coercion.Here there is neither force or coercion.I don't think this is blackmail exactly, because there is no force or coercion. However, one might argue that by offering the information for money, it could be.I would call the police and see what they say. Since the girl didn't do anything illegal (I assume?), it's not something the police would care about, but the threat is real.
No one should be treated like less than any other person based on the "accident of birth" such as their sex or race, or as the ryhme goes: "All men are created equal, what makes the difference is in the sequel". In otherwords what you choose to do with your life determines what you are worth, not teh color of your skin, your accent, sex, or age. If you can meet the criteria for a job you should not be judged by factors you were born with. No one has a right to discriminate against you or target you for scapegoating. Every person matters, man or woman, physically fit or handicapped, whether of European, African, Asian or Native American, etc. ancestry, and everyone gets a vote in how their society, community and nation is.
Most people, most of the time, rather than form an unbiased opinion (if such a thing even exists) about a certain issue, actually form their position due to emotional reasons - a gut feeling, if you will.(Edit: Please disregard my title; it is too general, whereas the last sentence presents my claim more precisely.)This is most evident when, for example, two people with differing views discuss politics. Each person will justify their opinion on ostensibly rational grounds. However, most political discussions end with both parties saying what amounts to "Your arguments are less convincing than mine." There is some "meta" reason causing the person to be more open to certain arguments than others, and that meta reason, which is the *actual* reason for the person's opinion, is not rational.
Neither one of these 2 Italian crooners were depsite their sucess realy gifted singers IMOBetween the 2, Dino had the better voice, more range and better tambre, Dino's early inspirations, his model singers when he was a aspiring singer were more blues and jazz basedFrancis had better phrasing and had a knack for using space anf timing far better than Martion. Frank also had better material especially from the mid-50s on when he had the extraordinary Sammy Cahn and Jimmy van Huesen writing most of his songs. Jazz musicians and fans enjoy Sinatra much more than Martin even though neither are jazz singers, The Chairman of the Board did have some jazz sensibilities and his songs have been recorded extensively by jazz musicians yet rarely have any of Dino's songs have.
We are just people at the end of the day and if knowone likes same sex relationships its there problem. I think that Gay and lesiban couples are not hurting anyone so whats the big problem. They should be happy and not live a lie! you can argue and say that god made a man and a women but i dont think that god would want you to be unhappy thats the main thing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Just really not a good experience here. The place was not too busy and everything was just so slow.  The staff was overworked I guess. The food when I came out 1 hour later, was not very good.  Don't order the mushroom stroganoff.  It was inedible. The sauce was just milk and the mushrooms to tough to chew. We had a group of 12 of us in the patio and it was really not fun.
