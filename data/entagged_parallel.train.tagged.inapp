No I wouldn't turn in my spouse. Just because the [inapp3] that i married killed someone doesn't make them a terrible person. People make mistakes.
according to a recent report 50% [inapp2] in NASA are indian IITians, just imagine that if those [inapp5] will [inapp6] ISRO then our status,value and astronomical knowledge of [inapp9] definetly increase.Now,think abt. IITians,students who are qualifying iit, they are known to be superbrain.If India is capable of opening hitech institutions,then why we are [inapp18] provide them a perfect job of their level.we are giving international status of education.then why [inapp20] take best advantages from them.this is due to brain drain,lack of industrial development,suitable working environment as well as proper salary.so its the need of the hour to improve our industrial sector.
Why is this up for debate? I understand that people have religious beliefs and stuff, and thats fine by me people should be able to do what they without being judged on every move they make, but it's scientifically [inapp13] the evolution is correct. What's your point?
hmm, yess there either all virgins or still live [inapp3] with there mothers and cant have porn LOL
it is not wrong, and if your talking about the actors doing the scene its theyre choice..they like doing it and [inapp7] degrading to [inapp8] they [inapp9] do it. we have [inapp10] of [inapp11] you know. and it also helps some of us to be open about sex
There once was a rapper who said he was the people's Champ. When wanting to be successful sometimes you need to worry about the common good because that's [inapp9] want. I believe that advancing the common good is a better endeavor. Because when always thinking about your self and your personal pursuits you tend to become conceited and become an A hole. And an A jerk is a person that's not liked and when alone and not liked by others becomes lonely.
It is a good thing because this shows that the [inapp3] everyone else accepts each other no matter where they come from, who they are or what religion they are.
The [inapp0] thinks he is the next level. Atlas would [inapp3] the world for a chance to shake his hand.
Water bottles can [inapp1] made into long term fiber materials, like clothing or carpet. It is easy [inapp6] fill cup with water and re use it.
TV is WAY better than [inapp1] from the blimem OLDEN DAYS!!!
[inapp0] better than book dathu ihfej tijkjdrk xtklp09 guil09 sfjiiytg dh,lut457 p[];o;l
I love TV sooooooo much I [inapp2] what ever i want and it is just the best.with TV you can watch DVDs and play on playstations.
We will be able to [inapp1] water bottles until we [inapp3] of this recession!
This idea is essentially playing with semantics.I did not propose that there be a separate but identical marriage for homosexual relationships and that it be called "civil unions.""Furthermore, the effects on society are bound to be minimal..."This is the type of reasoning that the slippery slope argument applies perfectly to. Why not let any small group demand a change with little relative impact?"...why challenge any assumption?"I'm not [inapp20] that law shouldn't change. I'm [inapp20] that law developed under one set of assumptions should be blindly applied to a different scenario. Read my [inapp20] to res0ndf7 for more on this line.
there is [inapp0] thing as "gay marriage". Marriage can only be between a [inapp4] a woman.
In Nebraska, it's legal to have [inapp2] by killing [inapp3] while it's coming out of the womb. How can you argue against that?
There should be no argument in this really...whatever way yu see a fetus...its still a living form that has been created in a very intimate way... you shouldn't be changing what mothernature or God or fate or whatever has decided for you...and if you didn;t wannna get preggo in the first place...don't have sex or use protection.Yeh there are some [inapp20] and it's very unfortunate but they should give the child up for adoption. It's not the child's [inapp20] that it was created. So [inapp20] the goring being have to pay the ultimate price of it's life?
There are tons of ways to not get pregnant. There are condoms (99% effective) for men and women, there are morning-after pills (75% effective), the patch, pill, and other forms of ways not to get pregnant. It's the woman's [inapp13] that she didn't do it.And maybe instead of Pro-choice vs. Pro-life, they (i don't know who "they" is) should have pro-life, but with exceptions (i.e. women [inapp20] raped) so that it's fair all-around.
If a women is [inapp1] is a good argument. However why would you punish an innocent [inapp5] with the death penalty for some other man's crime. If the women does not want the child she could give it up for adoption. I just dont understand why you would kill the baby, the emotional trauma would happen without [inapp19] as well.
You cannot choose someone's lifestyle because you don't agree with it. You cannot call someone's lifestyle a "choice" when you are not that person and know [inapp8] was not a "choice."
If you do not like gay marriage and thing it [inapp3] then do not watch a [inapp5] couple make out.Who [inapp7] to tell people that their veiws are incorrect and that they must change there feelings and that apparently they are wrong. Meanwhile, everyone is entitled to their opinions, but keep them to yourself. Do not try [inapp19] others based on your beliefs. It is selfish and takes away self rights.
I think that personal pursuit is more important because in order to help others you have to help yourself first. At the time it may seem selfish but once that you get to a [inapp11] you are good at what your doing then you can help others do the same. So not only are you helping yourself but you are also helping others.
Perhaps me:1. I hate bush.2. I [inapp2] christian ethos that he's trying to [inapp4] on the country.3. I'm a pagan, so not a christian, therefore i'm a threat.4. I'm a bisexual, and have had sex with guys, therefore i'm a threat.5. I don't aggree that what bush is diong is right for this country.and #6. I'm an individualist. I believe that the choices that we make in our lives are our own; rules, government, ect should be concerned with protecting our individual safety; not being concerned with controlling how we lead our lives, either on the spiritual or on the individual level.Because of this, i'm an anti-socialist :) Which makes me a direct threat to the government bush is trying to create. Therefore, i'm sure that my name is somewhere on his 'long' list of 'offenders'.
Do you want contact with your children? Then you need to step up and fight for them. California is pretty fair when it comes to dads. Your children have legal rights to have [inapp11] you. Unless you are found unfit for some reason. Do you have a court order? You need to find an attorney within the jurisdiction from the lastest court order. Good luck and you really need fight for this. Your kids need to have contact with their father, it may scar them for life you don't want them to think you abandoned [inapp20] you?
Usually, that isn't the question guys are asking... Oh, [inapp3] aren't the dad, but the mom. My bad.If you were the dad:You could always just give extra money that doesn't go throught the courthouse. Otherwise, you can request a review, which takes awhile to complete, but child support offices go to the employer and verify all of the income, and then reevaluates [inapp20] per month owed.Some states give cost of living increases every year, but some don't. Don't listen to the jerks telling you that you should be able to support the child on your own. You didn't get pregnant on your own, and you sure shouldn't have to support that child on your own. Circumstances change throughout life, that's why this evaluation is in place. Consider if you were both very young when you got pregnant and he was in college or working for minimum wage, but now he's got a decent job. It goes by a percentage of his income.
unfortunately I agreeunless there is something in it for usit's a hard sell to convince the us to send troops to police the world, though I do applaud it when we do. the troulbe is we always get caught up in the quagmire of international politics and never fully commit to a mission, thus we fall short and it looks like a half hearted attempt with casulties that we have a [inapp20] stomaching. Look up a group called Executive Outcomes to see how it's done right.
In a free society, there is no [inapp2] as the "right" to not be subjected to offensive things. If you read the newspaper, browse the web, watch TV, etc. you will be offended in the West. You do have the right to protest (peacefully), picket, rally other people to do the same.If their "deen" (a Muslim [inapp19] faith) is strong, they shouldn't worry about what some non-Muslim has to say about their religion.Yes, I've seen the cartoons. They're a lot less [inapp20] than what the OFFICIAL newspapers of some nations such as Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iran, etc. say about Judaism
I would say not all foreigners ..maybe unrealistic but it would depend on what country they are from ..er which country..Just as [inapp7] world has favs and non favs.. I think the non favs for countries already know who they are and why...If a nation is violent and not good for the world and the government..lies and steals..and kills innocent humans..well then.. it is not well liked ..or the people either..because the government is suppose to represent the people..So...it is the government that causes it and their people that pay for it.
no your not rascist for wanting [inapp2] to have the same rights as the "others". in fact you should have more rights if you were born and bred in the country but unfortunatley here in britain that is not the case we actually have less rights [inapp15] recieving less benefits if we become unemployed or sick as opposed to the imigrants (alot of which are illegal) who get much more of OUR money that we worked for which [inapp20]
Why on Earth do people answer these questions when they have [inapp3] what they're talking about? Sandytoes, asking a court clerk will do no good. They are not permitted to give legal advice.That having been said, why don't you give us some more details about the judgement. What was it for? When was it perfected? Why do you say that it is expired. What state do you live in?In California, for instance, judgements expire after 10 years. If the judgment has expired, it is probably not affecting your [inapp20] whatsoever. The only way [inapp20] get it off your [inapp20] report is to petition the court to have it expunged. Chances are real slim on that. Otherwise, you're probably just going to have to deal with it being there.
Our borders should be closed, we are at war we can not afford to take care of these people, we are not even taking care of ours. No one has a reason to teach them English, they can learn to speak English before coming over her to take the test. If I go to a foreign country I don't expect them to take the time to teach me their language, not even realistic. They need to go work at bettering their country just like we [inapp20] to do. How many of these "illegal immigrants" are fighting in our war? They need to go [inapp20] fix their country, while we try to fix ours, we do not have what it takes to keep everyone up any more. Close our borders [inapp20] we are on our feet again...and if you [inapp20] are on our feet do some checking around, it won't take you long to see what a shape we are in. You ask a very good question.
Firstly, Cops (nor anyone else) do not piss you off. You choose to be. If you choose not to be pissed off, then you won't be. It's called a Victim mentality. You own your emotions, no one else.Secondly, since I am a [inapp14] I can say this much… I remove skaters from areas that are posted with no skateboarding signs, where vandalism is a common occurrence or where there are trespass warnings (both the kind you see and the kind you never knew). I do not, nor do I know any other officers, that set out to “piss” people off. It is merely enforcing the laws that are applied upon them. You may not be a problem, but the two dozen other skateboarders before you might have been.
Yes to an extent, what is [inapp2] refered to as racial profiling makes sense (when not abused). For example: A car load of black or hispanic kids are rolling around a lets say mostly [inapp11] upscale neighborhood at 3 am,plates get run, and it's pretty obvious they don't live in the area and may be up to no good I believe is an acceptable type of profiling. I will [inapp20] same for a car [inapp20] suburban [inapp20] boys driving around the hood,in high drug areas etc. That contrary to popular belief is also profiling. Crime needs to be controlled and I dont personally see it as a violation of ones right's to be stopped when they are deemed to be suspicous. Of course people will call me racist etc, but to an open mind what I just stated makes sense and is fair.
You r wrong my dear they havent been shut down in India, the [inapp4] is only in Maharastra. The Gov had shut down because the [inapp8] had received many a compliants from the housewifes about their male familly members wasting money on ladies bars and not looking after the families. Also many criminal activities took place at this bars. U must be knowing the tarannum case, or telgi case where tarannum monthly income was arouned 1 lac and telgi would throw away nereby 1 lac per day on the bar girls. To put a stop on shuch type of criminal activities the Gov of Maharastra had put a [inapp20] on these ladies bar
First off the ancient rite of war [inapp2] nation has lived by including the Lakota, which removed the Nation that was here before them, the victor of war gets the land. While there was some chicanery and our forefathers only really won a hand full of battle the Indian Wars were more a war of attrition and the Nations lost the land due to that fact.Yes, we have contributed to the land, there are more trees than were on the Continent at the time of Columbus's landing. We grow most of the food uses to survive.
Here's another thing to think about...while some judges CAN be bought, they aren't [inapp4] real problem. The philosophy for being a judge is to have no political affiliate, to be fair and impartial, to listen to the merits of each case seperately and as presented. But some judges, especially a couple of new Supreme Court Justices, do not feel the need to represent the law, leaving their political views outside their courtrooms. Worse than one crooked judge in a million, is the zealot who believes it [inapp20] or her responsibility to "fix" what he or she believes is wrong in the world - and now has the power to do that! Scary stuff.
Women in many developed countries have the legal right to abortion in the [inapp4] an unplanned pregnancy. However, men often have *less* than no rights in cases involving potential parenthood. Men not only lack the right to choose whether or not they want the child to exist, but also whether or [inapp17] will support the child financially. If a woman has the ability to choose whether or not she wants to become a biological mother, it isn't justifiable to take away that decision from the biological father. **EDIT**: Some people have misinterpreted my post entirely. **I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT A MAN SHOULD HAVE A SAY ON WHETHER A WOMAN SHOLD HAV AN ABORTION OR NOT**. I simply believe that, following a woman's decision to become a parent, **a man should the have legal right to abstain from parenthood (the exact same option extended to said woman).**
The title is self explanatory. Vladimir Putin is the head of a disappointed ex-empire, willing to gain its former glory. The Russian people is a traditionally obedient one, willing to submit to an autocratic will, and [inapp12] devote itself to general patriotic ideals (i.e. getting new territories). The guy seems very determined not co comply with the Western moral and politic values and seems defiant to the present unanimity of attitudes against his latest moves. It is already quite obvious that Russia's stances in international politics is not a democratically generated one, but exclusively owed to Putin's will. He likes war, confrontation and seems indifferent to the human costs of his actions. He is determined to make history by any means, just like the celebrity killers do their crimes to get unforgettable no matter how.
These days, we grant more rights to convict's than we ever have. While I appreciate people make mistakes, I believe some actions should have permanent consequences, and that we have morally compromised ourselves in making exceptions to this. I fundamentally contradict [inapp13] individual has a right to live- if you are willing to put someone else right to life in jeopardy, then you have demonstrated that you are a net negative impact to society, and that as a whole we would all be better off if you were dead. Edited for nuance- you guys have made some good examples of grey areas- I'm not disputing that. This is more a question of the principle. Let's go ahead and refine this further- in the moment of endangering another individuals life, with out extenuating circumstances such as mental illness or protecting others, then in that moment society has a prerogative to take your life.
EDIT: I'm not talking about my parents here. They are wonderful people. I meant grandparents, cousins, uncles, aunts, etc. (Not brothers / sisters either, only child)Most of my parent's argument is that my family won't be around forever and that they would do anything for me. The thing is, I don't care that they would. I feel it's similar to having some [inapp20] almost-stranger say they would do anything for you. Just because said [inapp20] stranger would do anything for me doesn't mean I like them or I need to care about them. I don't want them to help me. I don't need them to help me. They expect me to love this [inapp20] stranger because this [inapp20] stranger would do things for me. This [inapp20] stranger means nothing to me and I find them annoying and rude.
Video games should be treated like a drug. Millions of lives are impacted because people are not MONITORED or don't use them in moderation. Especially children that are becoming consumed and obsessed, it takes over [inapp11] and social skills. It's so sad.I feel so strongly about this because I went through the same thing as a kid and I wish more than anything to go back to change it but also I'm grateful because now I want to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone again.Let's start a petition guys!
It is pointless. I see no positive thing about it. It is not the best way to communicate to people seeing at we have phones, email, instant messenger, video calls, and video chats. The apps have no meaning and are really not that fun. I also do [inapp15] why anyone would [inapp17] post about their feelings or what their doing and shout it out to everyone. I really do not care if billy bob is going shopping. It is also a place for online and maybe real life stalkers [inapp20] future stalkers.
If Iraq has taught us anything at all, it is that brutal, repressive dictators have their place in the world. If this administration had any brains at all, they would have had a Delta squad hunkered down right under the gallows with a stepstool, [inapp14] spirit Saddam away to his rightful place at the capital. It takes a mean bastard [inapp20] a 160,000 square-mile lunatic asylum.
I hear all too often that science is 'playing God'. We as a species have superceeded the need for natural selection. We must control our evolution to ensure our survival. Ever since 1999 we have decoded the human genome, and it is time we manipulate it. Our stability as a society has allowed the meek to prosper, not to say that this is bad, but it has proven damning to our condition. We grow ever [inapp20] as we use advanced medication to suffice our ailments to the [inapp20] we are not aware of our declination. The only fortitude is in our ability to plan our evolution. If [inapp20] did not intend us to do so, he is nearsighted. If god wishes us to stop, he is inhumane.-To play god is to assume the state of mind of supreme judgement. Judgement that self-validates the terms of life, and the value thereof. To play god is to take life. The only one playing God is the man with the gun.
First off, bribing a child would be defined as doing something like this (Now David, if you just put your shoes and coat on mommy will buy you a toy after we are don at the doctor's office) or (Karen, if you take the garbage out I'll buy that blouse you wanted) or (It's time to get off the swing, we have to leave...come on honey, if you [inapp20] we'll stop at the store and buy the video you wanted) or (just eat your vegetable and I'll give you extra icecream) this type of thing being said after pleeding with your child to do what you want.My point of view..bribing a [inapp20] wrong, you have to tell them what you want them to do and expect them to do it...if taught to obey you (thier parent/thier authoirity figure) this should be easy..soemtimes they may not like it...but they are still going to do it ....simply because you told them to.
sure why not, if that interests the young individual... its an art and takes time to perfect no different than cooking, so starting early would mean perfecting it sooner. it doesnt necessarily means that they're gonna be drunks later on in life, its still up to the person's discipline. there a lot of young drunks who were never bartenders, i [inapp20] they should include in bartending courses is a better understanding of alchoholic beverages and its effects.
So you dispute the Pontias Pilate account and testimony of the Jewish leaders? What crimes did Jesus supposedly commit? In fact, the Pharisees and Jewish leaders begged Pilate that a criminal be released so that they may torment Jesus. Pilate's wife begged that Jesus be released. Pilate himself was sorrowful and didn't [inapp17] Jesus, rather washing his [inapp19] of the matter.Hippie? I believe nomad would be a better term. And, in that case, he was no different than any other nomadic person or tribe. Most wore their hair long (except for proper Roman citizens), and togas [inapp20] robes. And sandals [inapp20] only footwear available. You are hardly justified in calling Jesus a hippie, much less the first hippie.And by all accounts, Jesus was a Nazarene.And Jesus being married is a fallacious assumption.The whole controversey is really based on whether or not He rose from the dead. Eye witness accounts claim that he did. What can you say to prove that he didn't?
The popular assertion is that IF dogs have the capacity to remember, it is a short term capacity. If a dog has learned not to go to the bathroom in the house through the use of paper training or kenneling, this is often termed conditioning.Perhaps in the example above, we are dealing with conditioning, not memory.How [inapp18] explain this: A dog is brought up with a child who leaves the home to go to college. The child returns home after being away for six months. The dog's reaction to [inapp20] entering the home is frenzied, lasts for quite a bit of time and is marked by whining and a significant sow of affection. These behaviors are not observed when a family member returns after being away for an hour or two. In fact the dog shows little if any enthusiasm in this instance. The dog is equally indifferent when introduced to a stranger.
the reason mariage should be kept sacred is for what the [inapp3] woman will produce, a childits the best and most natural arangment [inapp8] a happy and healthy child and the continuation of the family unita [inapp12] a man or [inapp14] a woman, not going to grow more branches of the tree, so shouldnt be called mariage, call it something else
Obama = good judgement, steady in crisis, [inapp2] minded, cares about all the people not just the wealthy, wants to build a green economy, PRESIDENTIAL.McCain = ourt dated thinker, not curious minded, too ingrained into the system he claims to want to change, has stolen every good postion he has in this [inapp17] from Obama, running a vile campaign and he approves the message, NOT PRESIDENTIAL.
It's better to be fatherless. Having a lousy father creates a bigger gap in your life than being fatherless. It is a proven fact that if you're a girl, you'll look for someone to be your other half that's similar to your father. Having a lousy father, for a girl, would mean having a lousy boyfriend as well. By having no father you don't have to worry about how terrible they are and all you have to [inapp20] ponder how amazing your dad could have been. Wondering what could have been is better than wondering how much better it could be.
Why [inapp0] assume that god needs to [inapp2] within the constraints of time when accusing him of wasting his time? :)
schools should have PE because the school i attend only has pe for middle school not [inapp5] we are a middle and a high school combined. because the lack of physical education in our high school many students are out of shape and have developed many bad non active habits and as our first year in sports our sports athletes have shown how hard it is to perform simple pre season conditioning and they quote "if we had PE conditions would be easier and would have made conditioning simple" the lack of exercise had [inapp20] them to only accomplish only 3 push-ups!
No one ever mentions that the cause of over 99% of all [inapp4] is unwanted pregnancies. If you prevent those, you prevent abortions. Wouldn't that make both sides happy?
Surely if we are [inapp1] the feelings of unborn children within the first few months of pregnancy, than we should first be [inapp7] protecting the [inapp9] far more conscious animals, such as fully-developed primates.If its isn't their feelings we are worried about, then I guess I am very confused about the pro-life point of view.
Evolution is a science. All the refutes I have seen (which I will [inapp4] after this) [inapp5] to do with science. Their claims are theological claims. Lets first know what science is. Science is known through the scientific method. The scientific method deals only with the natural world. Creationism tries to sneak the supernatural as a scientific explanation. This is called pseudo-science.
Not it's not. But along your line of argument, believe in "Creationism" and "God" is like [inapp5] that a puzzle can be solved by waving a magic wand. I mean, God wouldn't actually touch the pieces with his godly fingers would he?You clearly don't understand evolution. Read a book or two.
I note that whenever someone starts in on the "Porn is ebil 'n' degrading" spiel, they focus exclusively on women.As if there's [inapp7] thing as porn *actors*. (What, men don't count?)Porn is a form of entertainment. No more. No less. Any arguement otherwise is just "Feminist" bullsh*t.
A drop of water is worth more than a sack of [inapp3] to a thirsty man
The major water produceing companies are stealing water from our lakes in [inapp4] killing off habitats for criters that like water like platypus.
The other side is only [inapp1] song lyrics! That has nothing to do with water!
If being homosexual was natural then1. There would only be possibly 6 people on the earth...meaning none of the people making up these sarcastic remakes would be around....heck I wouldn't be around2. If [inapp11] was natural then the butthole would be in the front part of the body.Its never been accepted as "natural" by society only till now. So i'm pretty sure thousands of years of recorded human history have a little more weight than some piss ant [inapp20] venting on how its unfair.
we should not forget lord rama, krishna, vishvamitr etc which give far view [inapp4] will be the vishvguru in future
for [inapp0] is talking about RAPE in this subject let me ask you one thing!!!! if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience???if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!
when people condemned consensual-cannibalism in africa, did they think of these people's right to their bodies? no. why should abortion [inapp6] different?
I feel that a personal pursuit is a better endeavor. Your personal pursuit should come first before anyone else's. But then again I really don't know, because if someone in [inapp10] is in need of something then you're going to do anything help that family member out. I believe that helping someone in [inapp18] is just something you do no matter what because they're blood. If someone who you don't know is in need at the same time as someone who is related to you, you're going to help the family member out instead of the [inapp20] person you don't know.
i totally agree with you, these days what with dna its easier to prove someone is guilty, so when its [inapp6] someone is 100% guilty, yeah, hang em! especially paedophiles they are the lowest of the lowas for ians answer it may of been proven to not prevent further people killing but at least its less of a burden on the tax payer supporting scum like that in prison
I think not more rehab center but better ones. in jail they will NEVER become a [inapp5] member of society in most rehab's they won't either and they ones that are GOOD [inapp10] expensive for your common druggy to pay for so they quit and end up in jail. Put the people who HURT OTHER people in jail not the ones who just need help or aren't hurting [inapp20] themselves. And if they are hurting family because of the drug problem my [inapp20] why doesn't the family get them help then support them with it. Too many people go to rehab and [inapp20] and the people don't even try to encourage them to get it together.Fund better programs to clean them up and help them get jobs and then we don't have to pay for food and lodging for people who can get better.
I think black people shouldn't say either because [inapp2] is a word that divides races. If 2 black kids are hanging out with a white kid and they call each other the n-word [inapp11] kid just wanting to be friendly is going to want to [inapp15] word too because he will always feel like an outsider if he can't great them in the friendly manner they great each other.But on the other hand I am one of the few African Americans who feel this way. And I do agree why does it really matter so much to White Americans. Okay you can't have this one word you have all the other words to use plus you run the world, is it really so horrible that black people have this one thing.
It blows my mind how people can be anti-capital punishment and pro-abortion.Either respect all life, or respect all innocent life, but not the [inapp7] "don't kill convicted murders, but kill all the [inapp10] you want".BTW - to the person below... the Bible does NOT say "Thou Shall Not Kill"... it says "Thou Shall Not Committ Murder." There is a difference.
i think those kinda people that have children are just being selfish and [inapp4] about themselves..i mean think about the children?..i wouldn't [inapp7] have a mom and see her go through mentally illness..or a dad who is in a wheelchair..think a bout it...so my answer is no..give the kids a home where they have a mom [inapp19] bake cookies for them and a dad [inapp20] go out back and play baseball with them....so no, i do not believe that "everyone" had the right to have children
If the other 97% were banned, wouldn't those women start saying that they were raped, it was a [inapp6] incest, or that their health would not tolerate it?And then women would use metal hangers again, quite unhealthy.I do agree that cutting [inapp14] abortions in the US would be good. Birth control should be administered to anyone having sex.
Yes, it is. I've always been bothered by pricing based on age. Take movies, for example. A seat is a f****** seat ! Why should people between the ages of 12 and 64 pay more for the same seat ? And what the hell is a "senior discount" about ? I hear the same old old excuse that seniors are on "fixed income". What does *that* mean ? Aren't we *all* on "fixed income" ? My income doesn't vary. In fact, younger people probably have more expenses than older people, with the exception of prescription drugs.And what is this "kids eat free" b.s. ? Why can't I eat free ? I mean, Geez, the kids aren't paying for anything. Let me eat every [inapp20] meal free and I guarantee I'll come back to your restaurant.:-)p.s. for those who misunderstood the question, Jr. isn't in jail. He was "charged" an adult *rate*, not charged with a crime.
I don't like the idea of burning the flag, but [inapp3] it's supposed to represent, should allow someone to do so if they want to. After all, what is being destroyed is only a piece of cloth. Making a law which prohibits us from burning [inapp15] does much [inapp16] than the act itself. You lose so much more by [inapp20] people's freedom.LVprincess - "yea okay we have [inapp20] of [inapp20] and speech and all that crap" If you think [inapp20] speech is crap, then maybe your the one who needs to move.
If that happens the US will pull all our funding and whatever troops that are under their peacekeeper control.Without US support there is NO UN. So they can try. I would love to get rid of that organization it has done nothing but steal, bad mouth the US and Israel, and [inapp17] our money.We haven't done anything that we shouldn't have anyway. Well the Bay of Pigs but that was Kennedy leaving the Cubans out to dry
The first amendment, among other things, protects the individual's [inapp3] to associate with whomever he chooses. As far as I'm concerned, if two fellas want to free associate, they can do it as much as they like. But the day you tell me that marrying another man is mandatory, that's the day when I leave the US. Nobody's gonna force me to get [inapp20] married.
(pause here for deeply bitter laugh)...What an excellent question! Let's see, this is a poor woman? An immigrant? Not a [inapp6] woman?A woman whose family is not being torn to shreds over an agonizing decision about which they don't agree? This isn't an [inapp15] year? The Shrub is in enough hot water with the public without having this situation getting the same headlines that Schiavo's case garnered? In any case, while I agree whole heartedly with your implication that the "Culture of Life" folks are a bunch of politically motivated hypocrites, I find that I am a little grateful that this lady was permitted to die without being at the center of a terrible storm of public controversy played out among people who don't even know her.Cold comfort, but it's all I have some days. I'm very grateful she had family with her, shame that compassion moved no one to wait for her mother.
Almost all problems seen today (and throughout history) with [inapp3] in [inapp3] that we allow them to be bought with their own personal desires and selfishness. If we don't allow them to have the possibility of wealth, then we can put a stop to a lot of corruption. If a rich businessman gets into politics, he should give up all money and all other non-essential things. This will prove he isn't in it for the money, but for the actual job.I know [inapp20] of this being implemented are slim, don't use that as an argument.
To clarify, I don't believe the World's climate is static and unchanging, I just don't think it is nearly as dramatic as the media says. I dispute any major warming in recent times, and believe the whole climate change agenda is simply environmental lobbyists backed by politicians [inapp15] no longer refute the issue and still maintain their credibility. I used to be into the scientific side of it a lot, but I haven't for a while, although I will be corresponding with a mate of mine who is of the same opinion as me who is knowledgeable in the science. I have a fundamental distrust of most of the media in Australia (where I live), but I can't [inapp20] on the American media. I think it would be political suicide for any politician considering climate change 'denialists' are being hounded down by pretty much everyone. Skepticism and opposition to conventional scientific thinking is only a good thing, and I think the extent to which any skepticism of climate change is disregarded is appalling.
The right to be married is currently denied to most gay people in the word. That is a cause worth fighting for and a problem that needs rectifying. However, what exactly is there for transgendered people to fight for? It is already legal for people [inapp15] to to undergo hormone treatment and surgery to change their identity as much as scientifically possible. I have a few gay friends that resent the LGBT acronym and transgendered peoples' "uninvited" inclusion with the gay movement. They feel that the transgendered movement belittles and muddles what is a serious political issue today. I understand that transgendered people wish for societal acceptance want want their voices heard, but co-opting the gay platform is a cheap and selfish way to accomplish this.
Really? Why would anyone want more? A $70k [inapp2] is enough for you to pay for comfortable housing, transportation, and expenses even controlling for cities. The average American earns much less than $70,000 and gets by just fine. So [inapp13] anyone want to earn more than $70,000? How would more benefit you? If you have a job that pays you a $70,000 salary, chances are you would have vacation time. What would an extra $30,000 help you do that you can't do with your existing salary? There's no marginal utility as far as financial comfort is concerned.
I believe environmentalism is a great thing, don't get me wrong. But recently I think environmentalism could be categorized as a cult. They obviously have some great views and do help the planet, but the thing that ticks me [inapp13] "global warming". I think there is strong evidence that the earth is warming naturally because of the sun and not our production of carbon dioxide. But these radical environmentalists are literally attempting to form a kind of dictatorship, where so many aspects of life are strictly controlled to stop climate change. Anyone that questions them is a heretic, and even with overwhelming scientfic evidence against global warming, they persist. I am tired of overpriced "green" products, carbon credits, and attempts by them to [inapp20] dollars and slow down America's economy. They have gone from the point of actually focusing on real environmental issues [inapp20] feeding the public lies and creating new, pretend problems to [inapp20] our time. Discuss.
The present day crisis was brought on by the auto, petroleum, rubber and construction companies after WW2. Instead of maintaining, increasing public transportation and as suggested by [inapp9] devolping solar energy, they chased the big bucks [inapp12] public transportation, building hiways and freeways, malls and depending on fossil fuel while destroying the envoirmentThis is just a [inapp18] the chickens coming home to roost,
i [inapp0] should not wear school cloths because their so weird and the good reason [inapp5] that [inapp6] bulling and also THERE DUMB STUPID AND GAY
India will never lead the world as long as no [inapp3] understand what they are saying with their freaking accent ;)
He revived the cultural [inapp1] of [inapp2] by setting up schools for the Chinese and Malays and did a lot for the people while Farquhar just wanted [inapp9] control through his actions.
Debates are based on convincing evidence. There is very little evidence supporting creation, while there are massive amounts supporting an evolutionary argument.True. But, evidence must withstand the test of accepted truth. We can't say that creation is false, because there is no explanation provided for the origins of the "particles" that [inapp17] theory. Although the evolution theory is interesting, and quite possible, it does not rule out creation. Since creation cannot be ruled out in any way, and evolution can, creation is the best possible theory.
a common argument is, "what if [inapp2] was to be the next DaVinci?"there is a simple counter to this:what if [inapp7] who hets pregnant is to be a legendary figure in the world but never gets to because she has [inapp14] a [inapp15] that she was unprepared for.
Life has been around for [inapp1] years. Any failure to recreate it in a laboratory is purely because researchers have failed to devote those same [inapp8] years trying. :)
If you can, then please do so. Illuminate us with your facts!Do you have brain scans of the first humans? How about average organ sizes? Hair patterns? Facial characteristics? Heart rate records?Speaking of these factors, how do you sabrejimmy account for the different racial characteristics of modern humans? I'm married to a Japanese woman. Why do we look so different?Was there in fact an Asian Garden of Eden? And an African Garden of Eden? And a ...What [inapp20] actually believe anyhow?
I just don't see why [inapp1] so much. We're here. Whoop-de-doo. So go on and live your life! If you want to believe in creationism, that's great, good for you. If you want to believe in evolutionism, same thing. I understand that the point of debate is to get the opponent to be convinced of your side and everything, but I just don't see why even debating it is neccisary.Yet with all that said... Maybe it was a little hypocritical of me to post this. xD sorry.
I used to think that [inapp1] God was reasonable before the theory of evolution. However, the "who created the creator" argument seems to apply here. An all-knowing all-powerful loving, merciful, personal God is as complex a creature as I can imagine, so [inapp14] life cannot be explained by a [inapp16] creator.
I rather have a lousy father than not have one at all, because a father is one of the most wonderful things it could happen to you. At least a lousy father would be there when you need someone. You can [inapp13] on your father on anything. and i guess lousy fathers are like that because they love their child, and they want their son or doughter to be as perfect as posible.
I think is better to have a lousy father than a fatherless because you can [inapp5] on your father. No matter what your father is always going to be there for you in the good and bad times. If you don't have a father you don't really know what is [inapp16] wrong. If you don't have a father than you don't have nobody to [inapp20] with or tell him your problems.
you can just sit on the couch [inapp2] crisps or a burger or sweets [inapp5] tv when you cant be botherd to to anything else
it [inapp0] that bottled water is a waste, but bottles can be reused!
Two men/women together does not seem natural. Although we know the world is changing and there are new ideas the purpose of two humans being together is to reproduce and make new life. Marriage is in front of God and the words are taken from the Bible but it is obvious that God does not approve of this so doesn't it seem [inapp20] in a way?
Why don't we just get rid of any incentive to be married, politically that is. No tax deductions, no married filing jointly; nothing. Let the churches perform marriages, get the government out completely. If a particular denomination wants to condone [inapp13] let them, it's them that are going against their religion.I don't support it. Like I said, if there were not tax breaks or incentives to be married in the eyes of the state, who cares. My church doesn't support it. It irks me that people who claim to Christians support it and even allow homosexual clergy.
India and China could redefine what [inapp2] world country means because in the future, both will be first and third world countries simultaneously.
This debate presents a [inapp1] dichotomy in which the only options are christian or atheism. Shouldn't it be "theism or atheism or other"?
No matter what circumstance a woman is in SHE got herself pregnant! When [inapp4] occurs [inapp5] it the poor, defenceless [inapp7] who gets no choice and dies? The [inapp9] is innocent, yes it wasnt the mothers fault but [inapp13] she more important than a child?Women have become selfish where there bodies are concerned. They believe they have the right to [inapp20] and then get rid of [inapp20] because they feel like it and made a mistake. These are childrens lives we [inapp20] about
Expensive, embarrassing for some, [inapp1] for AP students that aren't in varsity sports because varsity athletes can waive the class.
How can anyone say that Gay Marriage is Wrong. It is a personal choice that is made from personal beliefs [inapp6] are we to say [inapp8] do not have the right to enjoy all of the benefits that [inapp13] do?
There is no provision in either document you cite which says keeping all the fruits of our earnings is a part of freedom.Now, our founding fathers were involved in colony govts before they were involved in rebellion. In Virginia, our house of burgesses provided money every year to every widow and orphan. We also applied our tax money to [inapp19] projects for the common good. We also had courts to help protect our rights. When we had our revolution, we were opposed to taxation WITHOUT representation, we were not opposed to taxation. We never have been.You have a pretty limited view of humanity and our responsibility to create a just society. Plus, you seem to be [inapp20] it on parts of our founding documents which don't exist.
if you are strong enough to relive the worst moments of your life again,then i say you should sue for compensation.money wont change what those evil bastards put you through.....but if you can get something out of the [inapp12] you have been through other than anger and bitterness,then why not. hope it all goes your way. u [inapp19] it, [inapp19] it.
The difference between the two is more like Dolphins and Porpoises not Lions and Bats.The reason one is legal and the other is not, is because the law says one is legal and the other is not. The actual difference between the two acts are hard to see. It is not [inapp17] have sex with someone for money, but is totally legal to have sex with someone free. It is not legal to have sex with someone for money, but it is [inapp20] legal to have film two other people having for money if you sell that film commercially. A rational, logical [inapp20] would never be able to understand this, which is why it is something only lawyers and politicians could [inapp20] with.The bottom line is they [inapp20] prostitution legal, they chose not to, they [inapp20] porn illegal they chose not to. It is one of those cases where the difference is only what the court says is the difference. Great question.
Actually you have it wrong. The justice system developed and practiced in the United States is the best that has developed in mankind in all of history so far. It is far from perfect. It is flawed. It is human. It is still the best we [inapp15] up [inapp16] far. No matter what media may claim and promote, it is getting better all the time, not worse. Because people do better and want better, we will become better for ourselves and our children.
You shouldn't [inapp0] get a realistic answer from anyone here because no one here (except you, perhaps), knows all the details of your case. It would take an attorney no small amount of time to prepare a defense for you, and nobody here is going to be able to offer you real help without knowing all the details. This is one of those situations where Y!A really isn't going to be especially beneficial for you.
Give me a break. Three strikes equals life! Live with it! You've been warned so don't ask for sympathy because it's "just a little pot". It's not like the [inapp9] strike was for [inapp11] only. He / She committed other crimes just didn't get caught. We as Californians are safer without them on the street. You know what they say... "If you can't do the time then don't do the crime.
Yes, if it's his baby. They're [inapp2] although they may be separated, they're still legally bound. The father has every right to demand that [inapp8] be given his last name and if I were him, I would refuse to sign the birth certificate if anything else was put in.Why assume the man left? She didn't say that in her question. She only said they were separated. Maybe the mother is the one who left!
Unfortunately, no [inapp0] re-open such a case, not without new evidence. The best you can do is go after your lawyer, but it probably won't help a whole lot. Very valuable lesson is to be learned here- you were so young when it happened- you body had many changes to go through yet and with Firestone's record, you should have had a clause put in the settlement (or not settled at all) that future consequences of the accident could be claimed.
I think it should be deemed as hear say and [inapp3] out immediately. It is inadmissible evidence. They cannot accept this as a confession because first, his low IQ made him easily susceptible to coercion. He was coerced into confessing. Second, there is no proof he spoke the words he is said to have uttered and the wording and thought process are to [inapp20] for this defendant. He is to incompetent to be able to think of problems in logical progressions.
Because in order to deflect from the fact that most [inapp3] killing their [inapp4] because they're 'inconvenient', they have to do a lot of scaremongering.So you have the 'rape' and 'incest' scare factors, and throw in the 'back-alley coathanger dying by the 1,000's' myth, and you've eliminated the picture of a tiny [inapp17] being chopped up and vaccuumed out, or being burned in a brine solution, or having its head pierced and its brains sucked out.I guess the feminists are still following Margaret Sanger's eugenicist desire to have fewer minority babies.
Yes i am completely for it. People are [inapp2] that it is barbaric and inhumane [inapp5] can stand up and say that some perv who has [inapp9] and killed a child still has human rights and the right to live. We would put down a dangerous dog why not do the same to some of the scum that lives in our country. The justice system in britain at the moment is hopeless. Far to many people are gettin away with all sorts and something needs to be done!!
i try to teach my children to "treat others as you want them to [inapp4] you, not the way that they DO treat you".as far as i am concerned, two negatives ONLY make a positive in math.therefore, torturing anyone or anything is COMPLETELY unacceptable. those who think that is acceptable are completely barbaric and would surely change their minds once they have been tortured.
Well, it would have been nice had you used spell check first...Your [inapp4] hard to read for [inapp6] us that actually speak and write in English...So my [inapp9] this is, which marriage were you speaking of???I am on marriage number 3 and at my age it would be foolish to act like a virgin this far into my life...I know others that are in their 5th marriage; you think they should wait too???Just exactly how much holier are you than the rest of us???My previous 2 [inapp20] had the exes walk out on me because of cheating, and I was not at fault...So we should study that aspect more don't you think???I do not agree with your logic or attitude... Sorry...You could never make it work...How would you ever prove it???
I scroll through Reddit and there seems to be long sections in the comments I can't even understand. People saying things to each other about Spaghetti? Quoting the transformers movies? Karma is spewing out and overflowing and not an original thought has been had. It's bullshit. Can't you people have your own thoughts, [inapp17] every concept you grasp dependent on it being intermediated by a career actor mouthing lines that have been signed off by a committee of movie company executives? I'm sickened.Only the first person to tell me "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn" gets an upvote. None thereafter.
I think that when [inapp1] about privilege, they forget about the most important one. Smarts. If you're smart, you can be a wheelchair bound and paralyzed, and still make it in the world. Case in point: Stephen Hawking.He's got almost nothing going for him other than his brain. He's still successful. You could be an African-American/Pacific Islander transgendered/multisex pansexual with chronic diarrhea, paralyzed from the [inapp20] down, and a triple amputee with body dysmorphia, but if you've got a 190 IQ, you can become rich. You can be famous. You can have a pretty good spot in life. Change my view.EDIT: Swearrengen changed my view. Smarts are worthless without motivation and dedication. The will to succeed is a lot more [inapp20] just being a smarty-pants.
I do not want to come off seeming that I'm speaking ill of the dead. I honestly hope I do not come across like that. That is not my intention. Marilyn Monroe is undeserving of the elegant, classy idol status she has and [inapp14] why:She ruined both her [inapp16] because she slept with other (married) men. There are countless reports of her being difficult and unstable in professional situations. The biggest reason is because she was a drug addict who died of a drug overdose. Now, none of these things make her a bad person (I'm sure the wives of the married men she slept with would disagree with that statement) but she should in no way be considered a role model to women. Any woman that exhibits [inapp20] of behavior today would be considered to be an asshole and coerced into going into therapy and/or rehab. Courtney Love, anyone?She was not classy. She was not elegant. At best, she was the Lindsay Lohan of her day. Change my view.
I have grown up in rural Ireland in a patriotic area and have been raised to detest Margaret Thatcher. In the early 80s while on hunger strike she denied Bobby Sands and other IRA members the title of political prisoners and they [inapp14] shortly after despite massive public outcry. Her time as prime minister saw huge decay in Britain's old industries as poverty became widespread in Wales, Scotland and North England. People I know from these areas hate her. But recently to my disbelief I met a man from London who believed she was a great leader. She is also referenced as "The Iron Lady". I cannot stand this [inapp20] how anyone can infuriates me.
The points against torture are numerous, but the most important one is IT DOESN'T WORK. All of these "ticking time bomb" scenarios are fantasy right out of "24". That just does not happen in the real world. Another point against it: aren't we supposed to be the good guys? How in the world do we [inapp18] keep our supposed moral superiority when we debase ourselves by stooping to the level of our enemies? If someone wants to argue we need to get down to our enemies level to really be effective in [inapp20] on terror, shouldn't we have rounded up all the German-Americans in WWII and burned them in ovens? Shouldn't we have gotten down to the German level to be really effective? I don't think the U.S. can seriously dictate to [inapp20] when it doesn't follow the dictates of [inapp20] Constitution.
The poor needs help! The rich will get richier and the poor will get poorer unless we intervene. And having poor people exploited is bad for society. No heathcare, no political and legal representation, and there will be [inapp12] spilled with a revolution (as we have seen in Cuba, Russia, and China), and it will usually result in a dictatorship. This does not mean taxing people 20%, rather, it just means making it a societal goal to help the poor and invest in the people.
Absolutely not. Why am I obliged to provide for my bum of a neighbor? You're in effect [inapp5] individuals to make contributions to charities without their consent. Set up voluntary support associations, with reasonable criteria for the support applicants (e.g. they're in [inapp14] of trying to get a job/education), and then I'm interested. Give tax breaks to those who contribute (this already happens when you contribute to a recognized charity). Provide insurance benefits only to those who've contributed in the past. Even require applicants to pay back the dole they've received, if you wish. But don't tell me what a worthy cause is. That's my decision.
This place is pretty damn ghetto. They had to break up a fight around 11pm and there's only about 25 people here. I'm also looking at a [inapp9] who's basically nodding off at a table, and it doesn't seem like it's from alcohol if you ask me.... Server was alright, they were out of 3 types of tacos as well as sour cream, which is pretty strange for a Friday night. Service was a little slow for a weekend night. We had a good time due to the company we were with but we probably won't be coming back for the next girls night.
My family always ordered from # 109 for over 10yrs, our house number ends 4949 and I, Sherie Arvayo, call from my cell, just lately the persons who answer the phone are very disrespectful when they can't hear what i'm saying and who ever [inapp14] at 4:59pm today rudely hung up on me. 2 months ago they messed up our order and whomever the manager was must have taught the employees how to act and talk unprofessionally. This is about the 4th time the employees are very disrespectful and mean. We decided to go with Papa John's for at least their employees are professionals and friendly.... I hope they close this store because you never know if or what they would put in our pizza!!!!
Terrible! I wish I could give a negative star. Bartender was rude, short and immature. She was eating at a table and was the only bartender, which meant having to go to her to get drinks. There were very few people despite it being a Saturday evening, and I understand why! We asked for [inapp18] and salsa she said they only have nachos. We ordered quesadilla, asked for sour cream and salsa which she brought for us. So....hmmmm, I guessed they have [inapp20] (nachos?) and obviously have salsa - so we asked her and her response was "it's not on the menu". I suggested that next time she should go into the kitchen and ask them to throw [inapp20] in a bowl and salsa in a bowl and bring it out, she told me I was being confrontational. I told her I [inapp20] the public service industry and I was just trying to help her out, she rolled her eyes. We will NEVER go there again.
I want to mention about wearing school uniform by high school students. it really makes no sense, it's the opposite, it just makes troubles within students and teachers relations. People aged 16-18 do not like any limits and sometimes limiting their [inapp13] can become very serious problem followed by misunderstandings with the rest of people like parents and teachers. What about the controlling person's behavior - it must be done in the childhood, but not in the age when students become adults.
uniform sucks. wearing uniform doesn't mean better learning at school (students go to school to learn to prepare for their future, not to [inapp7] money to buy uniform ).. NO CONNECTION BETWEEN UNIFORM WORN N SCHOOL RESULTS...
First of, India does NOT have the potential to "rule" the world because [inapp4] seen the people? Good Indian people with good minds are in some foreign country getting a Nobel prize while the others are just stuck ups who don't do anything and [inapp15] the people who come up, down. Nobody actually lets anyone succeed. That's why!
When Raffles came back after a period of time, he changed [inapp3] and concepts Farquhar had set according to the people's needs. This can show that he cares for the people.
FOUNDER IS NOT A PERSON WHO "DISCOVERS" A PLACE if so i can [inapp4] prince Sanila Utama is the founder of singapore!(this for some who say farquhar saw the island first) And I do know that farquer has been very involved in this help and sometimes even does all the work but let me remind you that being raffles "assistant" he still had to consult raffles and raffles had all authority over Singapore therefore he was given credit. Then i would like to ask u a question why then does the names "raffles institution" "raffles hospital" raffles medical clinics"
I become suicidal thinking of the one i love most getting [inapp3] other women.
There has to have been a creator. If you believe in 'The Big Bang', then that's fine. But what [inapp6] it? And if it was [inapp8] by certain gases reacting with each other, then where did those gases come from? It doesn't matter how you think this universe came to be. The point is that it can't have just appeared. There must have been a creator.
What I meant was that in the situation, both moths were present at the time of the observation - both colored moths were on the trees to begin with..."Then the darkness was selected for when [inapp11] changed during the Industrial Revolution."-Who selects this mutation to occur? Does it just happen by good fortune?
In the 21'st century, we [inapp1] to a point where the only way for us to evolve is to start to create. Creation is evolution just with more responsibility placed on mankind.
I like to think both are true.1. God created the first things (i don't think adam and ever were really human, maybe single celled. but man had a hard time believing that so we made the first creatures Man)2. Those things God created Evolved to fit their surroundings. (there is proof of this, you [inapp18] deny this. i do not know if we came from monkeys or not.)I believe in God and Evolution.
well [inapp0] water bottle consumption on the planet earth, we could cover all of mexico 3 Times, of could that would be a lot of "rich" in their mind Mexicans.
Take, for instance, Pepsi's Aquafina or Coca-Cola's Dasani bottled water. Both are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines alongside soft drinks - and at the same price. Assuming you can find a $1 machine, that works out to 5 cents an ounce. These two brands are essentially filtered tap water, bottled close to their distribution point. Most municipal water costs less than 1 cent per gallon.So [inapp20] you pay for something that comes out of your sink.
Gay marriage should be between a [inapp2] a woman.
To say India can not lead the [inapp2] to say that a newborn child can never walk!!! I agree that there r so many problems that the rising India is facing 2day bt we r getting better day by day!!!
Is personhood absolute [inapp1] it predicated upon position?If a premature [inapp3] is lying in an incubator or, let's say for the sake of argument, a 5 gallon pail, it [inapp10] to kill it. Why does the situation change so drastically just because the [inapp15] inside the womb?
I choose life. Keeping the law pro-choice is allowing [inapp3] murder their own [inapp4] human child.
No. PE has been around since more than 200 years ago. Today, the PE is barely taking any effect, mainly because of kids stuffing themselves up with junk food. We should [inapp10] with better ways to prevent obesity, such as a healthy eating campaign.
No one enters suit justly, no one [inapp2] court honestly; they rely on empty pleas, they speak lies, they conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity. Therefore justice is far from us…Judgment is turned away backwards, and justice stands afar off; for [inapp14] has fallen in the public squares, and uprightness cannot enter. Truth is lacking, and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey.
CarCraze --- you are wrong, sorry to sayWhat you have there, my dear, is a bona fide Court Order for you to appear in court to answer to a Motion to Collect a Debt. If it is on Court paper and has a case number, call the Court to confirm the Docket Number, and find out when the hearing date is.YES, they do have that power.YES, That is the equivalent of a Subpoena.If you "just let it ride", as you say, don't be surprised when you open up your paycheck and you find a good chunk of it GONE !What you should do:Seek legal counsel (get a lawyer) and [inapp20] with a manageable payment plan that is both satisfactory to your creditor, and workable for you.DON'T HESITATE - you will regret it.
Ever since Bush got away with tax-payer dollars funding Faith-based Initiatives, which is clearly unconstitutional but no politician will touch it in fear to be painted anti-church, there has been a movement in this country for more religious or power of the church.People don't realize how powerful the catholic church is. Do a little research and check [inapp19] wealthy they are. It will shock you. There is no way they are going to like China not 'obeying' their (not God's) rules.
Australia has no basic human rights under the constitution. We have no Bill of Rights like in America.Any rights we do have are established by the courts.In relation to your issue, contact a women's legal service or a women's shelter for advice about what you should do. The question may be whether he has bashed [inapp18] as well (or is likely to), but I am not a lawyer so [inapp20] for sure.
nuitsen I agree that it was not ethical and was even insensitive, but they were done in response to the [inapp6] and they certainly don't respect others beliefs and truths....what is the difference?s_s2You do [inapp11] all the people (muslims) who are not [inapp14] protesting about the suicide [inapp16] when Islam, so we are told, is a peaceful religion. It is the [inapp20] who have no respect for others beliefs...they are even killing fellow Muslims in Iraq but I don't see anybody protesting about that. I was referring to the suicide bombers and not Muslims as a whole.Melliare?
Depends on your state...Here in Nebraska Legal Majority age is 19. Most states it is 18, but there are special circumstances in most custody agreements that support is necessary through high school. Sounds to me like your daughter needs a swift kick in the pants! It is a very difficult thing to deal with...watching your daughter self-destruct but it sounds like you have no choice. IF she was still living with her father you should be giving him money towards her support...if she is "on her own" in her own apartment, you have no obligation to pay an 18yr olds rent. I would [inapp20] she is on her own...IF she wants to come [inapp20] finish High School she can...but if she wants to be a Junkie...she is on her own. She can move into the Dope mans house, get a job, or [inapp20] the army. All you can [inapp20] keep a light on and pray...but you dont have to pay...
I don't think that it should be a Gov't choice...It should be the owner of the property choice....I [inapp6] to be somewhere where smoke bothered me because most places are non smoking...bars here in Ohio aren't most anyway...and that doesn't bother me at all...maybe the next day after smelling my clothes and hair but my breath probably stinks just as bad after a night of drinks. This is just a way of people controlling and getting money...one of the issues on the ballot if you read closely says money for the "clean air fund"...if they band smoking why would you need a clean air fund...and what on earth are you going to do with that money? I prefer my money to go to my child's college fund...but If this passes I won't have a choice will I?
In my opinion, no. How would that effect the child is the first concern. When the [inapp5] small wouldn't be the issue, but as he/she entered school it would most defiantly get ridiculed by the other kids and have emotional stress/problems from this. This would really confuse the kid! I don't care what anyone says, a child needs a MOTHER and a FATHER. Not two women, and not two men.
If you are [inapp1] having the government interfere with what [inapp3] parents and responsible adults [inapp5] teach our children, then no. With regards to the FCC, and what is transmitted over the airwaves and is available for public display, yes. However, the government should also set absolute specifics for such media outlets. But when it comes to moral standards, parents, should simply [inapp20] their lazy asses, and teach their children right from wrong, talk with them and keep an open line of communication.
Here's always been my thought: I'm Irish and don't complain that Notre Dame's nickname is the "Fighting Irish." I don't go around saying my [inapp8] is being mocked [inapp9] I'm offended because "people think I like fighting." It's ridiculous. If any Native Americans are really concerned about this issues, why not look at poverty on the reservations, poor schooling, etc? There's so much more to worry about than school mascot names.
screw american law. You don't need a peice of paper from anyone to prove to you YOU are married and want a [inapp7] commiment from the person you love the most, just [inapp10] she's your wife and hold a ceremony somewhere the both of you find attractive and and share your thoughts on the future and express your love for one another. And don't forget to continue this thinking in every day for the rest of your life. Cause [inapp20] it is all about.
Your client? Give me a break man...you are some crack [inapp3] conspiracy theorist...first there is no consistent question within your rant of improperly [inapp7] English (incomplete) sentences. Second, the racism charges in your "question" make it highly suspect. Honestly, I am glad that your "client" is not allowed in the US, because if he "hired" you, he should not be here.
The adverserial legal system is governed by [inapp2] of conduct and engagement imposed on both parties. In that sense it is [inapp7] as it provides a structure for "fair play". However, a lawyer's job is to win a case hor his/her client. Taking advantage of loopholes in the law is one way to beat the otherside. In some cases, this may not be ethical. Nevertheless, the legal process that we have provides the best way to redress a wrong since a party that feels its claim was not handled well/fairly within the scope of the law, can in some cases seek further action through the appelate courts. This is as good as it gets folks! The alternative would be Hamurarbbi's Sheria/Law, where justice is meted out in the form of chopping off body parts.
Firstly does your bf own the company [inapp2] he a worker?Secondly unions are legal and allowed to sign up members. However this [inapp7] it goes a little far, unless your bf has done something like cross a picket line , then he better know he's not going to be liked or respected and that's why he's being called a rat and a scab. As for the other man is he really an illegal allien? Then INS could come in and send him back .You know unionism only grows when the employees sense that management is not dealing with them fairly and respecing the work they do. When people do not feel valued or respected or acknowledged for their contributions then they become angry and [inapp20] back in the only way they know how as a group.Unions are not all demons nor is management always the enemy however if that's how management and union posture themselves then there won't [inapp20] kind of labour peace.
I use to be able to watch that show with my family but it has become nothing but cheap sex jokes. And I'm embarrassed to watch it with them any more. The questions are posed in such a way to elicit a 'dirty' response from the contestants. And when they do answer accordingly, Steve makes a shocked face to the camera as if that reply was so unbelievable. Every. Fucking. Time. I've noticed he has been getting lots of love on Reddit [inapp20] and I am surprised by this. Steve Harvey has taken the family out of family feud.
Yes, I understand the fact that there are studies showing how young men can be more reckless than women, but that shouldn't be a good enough reason to treat men any differently than women. For example, "Whites, who make up 78 [inapp13] the U.S. population, accounted for 35 [inapp16] the state prison population. Blacks, who make up 13 percent of the U.S. population, were 38 percent of the state prison population. Hispanics, who make up 17 percent of the U.S. population, were 21 percent of the state prison population." Does this mean Blacks or Hispanics should be treated differently just because there are statistically more of them in prison? No. This, I feel, is a good analogy as to why men should be getting the same insurance rates as women.I'm not a 'masculinist', but It just strikes me as unfair. I would love to hear some other opinions! Thank you for taking the time [inapp20] :]Edit: I'm talking about car insurance.
I really see no benefits in governmen recognition of marriages. First, the benefits: [inapp4] fights about what marriage is. If you want to get married by your church - you still can. If you want to marry your homosexual partner in a civil ceremony - you can. Government does not care. Instant equality.Second, this would cut down on bureaucracy. No marriage - no messy divorces. Instant efficiency.Now to address some anticipated counter points:The inheritance/hospital visitation issues can be handled though contracts (government can even make it much easier to get/sign those forms.) If you could take time to sign up for the marriage licence, you [inapp20] as easily sign some contract papers.As for the tax benefits: why should married people get tax deductions? Sounds pretty [inapp20] to me. If we, as a society want to encourage child rearing - we can do so directly by giving tax breaks to people who have and rare children, not indirectly through marriage.CMV.
Every time I see the news, whether it be CNN, Fox, or BBC, I see in the headlines "ISRAEL BOMBS GAZA; WONT STOP DESPITE KILLING CIVILIANS." I see [inapp9] of casualties to both sides and things just don't add up. I think it is possible that the Palestinians are taking up military strongholds in public compounds such as schools and hospitals, taking hostages (which could help account for [inapp20] of civilian casualties), and minimizing their military casualties by allowing the Israelis to destroy these compounds while under the impression that there are more soldiers there. What the world sees is the Israelis bombing the shit out of a bunch of helpless civilians, resulting in genocide. The end result is [inapp20] against a UN affiliated nation that is "mercilessly committing genocide against a smaller, helpless nation" despite all of the tension between these two nations that led up to this.
I know this is a touchy subject and most people will go with the capital punishment law, however I currently believe that we let these guys off too easy and they will think it's okay to do again and again Honesty if some sicko did this to your child and caught them what would you do? I'm only 23 and this subject angers me greatlyI chose the age of 30 because I believe the age gap between 30 and 17 (or younger) is too bigI feel like this should be only done for sexual crimes because I don't [inapp20] could possibly get turned on by murder I could [inapp20] though.I belive castration would be a suitable punnishment because you wouldn't really be able to [inapp20] a minor with out a penis.
I already thought it was very likely in the near term and even long term George W Bush was going to go down as the worst president in history, but now after we are seeing Iraq unravel, I'm sure of it.Lets review all of his failures:1. Asleep at the wheel/ignoring all the warnings for 9/112. Completely false/made up pretext for [inapp20] in Iraq (WMDs), completely destabilizing the [inapp20] (as we are seeing now) for decades.3. After starting two wars in the middle east, engaged in doomed attempt at nation building/bringing democracy in order to enrich the military industrial [inapp20] and oil buddies.4. Asleep at the wheel during the housing/finance bust, presiding over the worst recession since the great depression.5. Cut taxes for the rich bringing us the biggest deficit and debt in history, resulting in MASSIVE spending cuts on social services during the great recession.And probably many more I'm leaving out, but I think this is enough to get this conversation started.
In my opinion, all it serves to [inapp2] remind men to fulfil the traditional gender roles. To "be a man" you have to provide for your family, be responsible and protect your family. It's the male equivalent of "be more ladylike". All it accomplishes is: * Make non-traditionally masculine men feel like shit * Reaffirm that men are the leaders and protectors of society It implies that these particular values are men-only, and that women aren't supposed to have those values (if they do, they're told to 'act like a lady'). And god forbid that men have some values that [inapp20] 'supposed' to have.Why not have a gender neutral phrase? "Be a better person"?
Yes, the president should be impeached. Ladies and gentlemen, if you are not aware of [inapp5] crimes and crimes against humanity that George W. Bush, becuase of multiple instances of "misinformation" that was given, or possibly not as a result of, we must all agree that George W. Bush us one that should be impeached. Remember this: while Bush is not currently the worst, he is among the worst, and we must find someone more competent with the politics and world affairs of the United States of America that will bring us into this time of need for leadership, albeit only for two years. With that, let us vote PRO to impeach Bush, a committer of multiple crimes against the people of the United States of America.
1) Gold standard: Gold is inflexible and too slow in growth. It will not catch up to our economy. Also, banks will fail, destroying our economy.2) No IRS: government loses income, stopping our ability to carry out fiscal policy and adjust ourselves out of recessions and overheat, annihilating the moderator system of our economy.3) Quit UN: I have [inapp19] why he wants to do this. Something with the debt. But the UN membership fee won't cause a big debt.4) Quit Japan: There is a reason the last military [inapp20] for NKR was to shoot a missile over Japan. I wonder what they were practicing for.
Absolutely. What practical application is there in knowing whether or not there was life on Mars? Other than curiosity what could we hope [inapp7] when the [inapp9] suffering being torn apart by war, starving, job loss on the rise? Which is not to say I am not curious, that I am not fascinated when I get to watch a good program about space, I am. But we need to focus our resources on fixing what [inapp20] here on Earth before we go chasing the curios of the galaxy.
Yes, I do believe so. Within in reason, of course. In the earlier stages of life, physical consequence is more receptive to children than verbal scolding. I do not believe that you can label a bad parent if they occasionally hit their children. This [inapp14] of discipline has been apart of parental doctrine since the beginning of man. It [inapp19] effective and, if administered properly, harmless to the child. The argument that the societal acceptance of child spanking condones or escalates child abuse is unsubstantiated. Most cases of child abuse are fueled by unrelated issues involving the parent (ie: alcoholism), not the failure of the parent to exact the correct degree of spankage. Vilifying the proper use of child-spanking condemns good parenting.
As tempting as the "week debate" pun is (and it is!)....Isn't it bad enough that the year supposedly starts in the middle of winter, so that each year gets TWO winters? Why [inapp10] want to split up our weekend so that it's only one day long on each end? A work-week is five days, then two days of play; lather, rinse, and repeat. Or take the "week" off and go skiing, but that's neither here nor there.I prefer calendars that start with Sunday 'cause it's prettier (symmetry!), but window-dressing aside, the week starts on Monday.
When [inapp0] out of [inapp1] High School or whatever, like in a office. You have to choose yr own clothing.
I find that whatever works for a person individually, is good. How would I be able to say something is the best, when, it doesn't work on someone elses computer? I vote for Firefox, because in my experience it has worked multiple times better than Internet Explorer. The config isn't too bad, and [inapp17] you who know about:config know what I'm talking about. The tabs are great, and has many good extensions. Though not the best, it is definately superior to Internet Explorer. Especially after the laughable 7 update. ;D
Since when is Firefox an Apple fad? There have been more Windows than Mac Firefox downloads since day one.If you are "original and free minded" then [inapp8] the browser with a 58.6% market share? How is using the browser everyone else does "original"?It's not even worth rebutting the second paragraph of your argument, as it doesn't contain a single fact and really isn't even an argument either.
The increasing population means less land, and less land means a big crowd on every place. India is able to win [inapp7] medal of corrosion, [inapp8] , illeteracy, violence, etc.
It can be either way, but I think being fatherless is better than having a lousy father because sometimes [inapp6] on your nerve and they make you do things you don't wanna do. But hey that's the way fathers' are. You still have other peoples to look up to even though your dad is not around.I'm used to being alone with my mom without my dad there because he passed away when I was six. So, I really don't have a favorite side.
SchoolingRaffles established the Singapore Institution ( Now known as Raffles Institution ) which completed its construction on [inapp5] 1837.
Raffles conceived a town plan to remodel Singapore into a modern city. The plan consisted of separate areas for different ethnic groups and provision of other facilities such as roads, schools and lands for government buildings. In October 1822, a Town Plan Committee was [inapp14] by Raffles to oversee the project.
Raffles found that Farquhar had done a bad job of raising the city of Singapore, he also introduced opium selling into Singapore in order [inapp8] more money [inapp9] Singapore.
IF YOU go live in that olden time conditions in just one month [inapp4] conditions it would be a surprise if you did not catch a disease every single day.hospitals was one thing raffles built and that would have [inapp13] so many people [inapp14] times because the living there was conditions were bad. another reason he has helped on the development
Ah yes, the classic peppered moth argumentI'm very familiar with itI'm not [inapp4] that [inapp5] the evolutionary processBoth moth colors have always been thereIts just a matter of which is it easier for their prey to see. That's not evolution-That's a diet plan
Im going to take the Obama approach to thisAbortion is never something a women would take lightly there will always be a lot of thinking [inapp8] help and even praying involved with making that decision. The pro-life people just don't seam to understand that [inapp15] think the abortion is a sad and awful thing and we pro-choicers hope nobody would ever have to make this difficult and life altering situation. there for this decision should be left to the women and not some man miles away in d.c. that has never faced it
How can that be? How were you brought up? Did you go to church? Sunday school? Pray before meals? Pray at school? Pray at night?I remember at the age of 7 when I started questioning the Lord's Prayer in school. And God. It didn't make sense. So I stopped [inapp16] God was real, and stopped [inapp18] Lord's Prayer (thankfully my public school system stopped that practice).So please tell me where I have been brainwashed.
yas,of course . School uniform is important1.school uniform is a logos for our school2.to remind us that we are part of the school3.and if we use the uniform basically student used to [inapp10] are they gonna do to, is it positive or negative4.in the morning we should use our uniform and if were not use our uniform the teacher give us a punishment and from that we can learn to be a discipline student5.if we go out from the school than the teacher will see we used the school uniform so people will know that we from that schoolthankyou
If you don't save the bottled water for an emergency you are not thinking about later you are thinking about now. You are drinking bottled water when you don't even need to. Bottle water and tap water is the same thing. Bottled water-has more [inapp14] and you have to pay for it. Tap water-has all the same things as bottled except no price and no [inapp20]
nowadayz no [inapp0] liv wdout t.v... its common [inapp3] t.v to all... so......... t.v ix beter than bookxx.... evrybdy vot for t.v....
AS long as people recycle the evironment, the water bottles are [inapp3] and poluted. Its not the water companies fault.
The Marriage issue should be out of politicians and lawmakers. Marriages are for the Church to decide, Congress have no [inapp6] a legislation [inapp8] religious institutions about marriage. Maybe, if the courts were to allow gay marriage, it would be alright since it is not a religious institution, it doesn't break the Separation between Church and State ruled by the Supreme Court.
Christianity: [inapp0] rape, genocide, hell fire, unscientific claims, superstition, eternal torture, pedophilia, incest, matricide, infanticide, bestiality, talking donkeys, talking snakes, etcAtheism: the rejection of these claims based on logic, observation, and common sense
If God doesn't exist, [inapp1] there are loads of predictions, sent by God, written thousands of years before Jesus saying exactly what happened to Jesus?
honestly who cares - if people want to be together so be it.it isn't like marriage is some high holy thing - we sell it on tv, in drive throughs, etc. and that is fake love.If people [inapp12] to be together then who [inapp14] to tell them no. If you don't like what they do, don't be their friend.plus what will you do when you kids are gay?
Three of your links are from right wing/conservative groups. Especially against gay marriage. They are extremely biased. I did not even have to go to the sites to know that.Those three are #2,#3, and #5 on your list.#2 is a polling company, if I recall and 'try' to write intelligently, but don't have research behind their writings.#1 has no real barring on [inapp20] at hand.
There is an argument of people saying is [inapp2] marriage acceptable or unacceptable. I would say most of the population of Britain would say it is wrong however I think anybody should be allowed to express there feelings to the one they love so I think it is acceptable. Because [inapp16] we can get married to the other secuality however a man can't express his feelings to a man or a [inapp20] a woman as gay sexuality I think gays should be allowed to do what they like when they like !!
I feel that a personal pursuit is a better endeavor. Your personal pursuit should come first before anyone else's. But then again I really don't know, because if someone in [inapp10] is in need of something then you're going to do anything help that family member out. I believe that helping someone in [inapp18] is just something you do no matter what because they're blood. If someone who you don't know is in need at the same time as someone who is related to you, you're going to help the family member out instead of the [inapp20] person you don't know.
You don't say anything about your homelife. You have to have a very good reason for it. If you could get a job w/in walking distance, I think they consider that reasonable. I put up with a lot of physical and mental abuse until I was old enough to leave home .... and I still recommend staying [inapp19] as long as you can. If it is your homelife that is the problem, get Social Services involved.
Americans as a whole do not think this way. There is much controversy in our country about this issue. It is currently legal in most (I believe) states to have an abortion, but [inapp11] religious zealots are always trying to change the law. Obviously, I am pro-women's rights (not pro-abortion and not pro-life, but believe that since it's the woman's responsibility it ultimately needs to be her choice.)
This is a great question! I actually just learned all about discrimination in the workplace, and covered this. It's funny, because the law states that [inapp8] discriminate due to sex, color, or age. However, [inapp11] men are the only group that is not covered in a protected class. So, technically, yes it is [inapp18] exclude them, but they are not protected! Seems kinda funny, but how often in America do they need protection...?
how do you [inapp1] got our [inapp2] by standing back.in the public eyes iraq does not [inapp5] freedom like ours. we need keep fighting the terrorist for the people OF THE WORLD from the terrorist who rule it. and we are not dictator we are [inapp15] fighters who [inapp16] FREEDOM, JUSTICE AND LIBERTY. unfortunitly people lost sight of it and voted wrong yesterday. and morally we are now also headed in the wrong direction. people need to be responible for their action and not [inapp20] it on science or the society.finally for the budget there goes the state and national level budget and economy and our taxes. people what things to be in place for a better country and community. [inapp20] think we pay for it in the long run. we do [inapp20] taxes, not with the so called federal and state money people [inapp20] have. country is in a mess thanks to the ungrateful american public who forget how our free
i [inapp0] agree with you for the same reasons. my animals suffer every year as they seem to go off weeks before now. [inapp7] main displays are starting earlier.the first big display i know of was a few weeks ago in the middle of October! what happened to November 5th! if it was one night only it wouldn't be so bad.i cant sedate my animals because it goes on for weeks. they are terrified!even though the sale of fireworks [inapp20] to kids, they still get them just as they do cigarettes and alcohol.they are dangerous [inapp20] another tool for those intent to be a menace to the public. it should be [inapp20] sell them in shops. organised displays should be set for the one night only, so us animal lovers can help our pets by sedation.you are so right on this subject x
Thanks for bringing up this important issue.Most of the things you [inapp3] have beneficial uses. The danger if they are misused. I think the Bush administration has demonstrated how our rights can be undermined. They [inapp11] of retaining the prisoners in Cuba for the rest of their lives, without charges or benefit of legal defense.The only way to protect our rights is to participate in [inapp20] of government. I hope anyone who reads this is [inapp20] to defend liberty with their vote on the 7th.
I agree with you. If a person WANTS to say the Pledge before a meeting (game, class, etc) then they should be allowed to do so. No one is [inapp9] others to [inapp10] in and pledge -- they are perfectly within [inapp13] to abstain. It really p*sses me off [inapp16] try to claim that just "hearing" the pledge violates their rights. Well, what about my right to assert myself and my allegiance to my country?? I would think that would trump anything else.
Yeah, it's biased. But what do you expect from a corporation that readily hands over personal Internet subject search records of Americans over to Bush and Co. in the administration's guise of cracking down on porn? From what I heard, [inapp13] use people to fill Yahoo Answers with questioners and answerers that push the Republican agenda.And it was dumb to pose that question. It is a crime to threaten the President and even though you weren't trying to do that, it can be interpreted that way--especially by this president. But I've noticed that they've let a lot of your other questions slide by which violates their vulgarity standards, but I guess as long as you're not offensive in a political way, then are fine with it. I'm sure most conservatives are like that.
This is one of the fundamental protections in a civilized society. We [inapp4] reduced to the level of a police state. I don't [inapp8] Bush for [inapp9] this power; I [inapp10] a cowardly congress for granting it. That's one reason the nation rejected the GOP.To answer the previous post, the President can declare ANYONE, not just foreigners, a "person who might be aiding terrorists", and then hold them indefinitely at an undisclosed location. Effectively, this has entirely negated habeas corpus. The President is not required to explain to a court why he believes someone has aided terrorists, so he could literally choose anyone, and no-one, not even the Supreme Court could require him to produce that person ever again - people can now just 'disappear' - as happens in facist dictatorships.
I heard that in Australia and US (I think, 2 countries that use ID cards anyway) there is a much higher rate of identity theft, because all someone would need to steal your identity is one card instead of having to go through loads of bills etc. to get all your details. I think it's the most stupid idea and you'll probably end up having to have an ID card to prove who you are in order to get an ID card, or you'll need a passport, driving licence or some other [inapp20] that not everybody has.Then again if they introduced them and someone stole the identity of someone like the prime minister and got all his money then they'd just see how silly an idea it was.
Fair trade capitalist. Extreme right, I hate any form of marxism. I believe a man should be judge by who he is not his hide. I believe that the solution for the problems of this world is found in the bible. Public [inapp14] a [inapp15] of money, due to the literacy rate and no basic understanding of economics.Having this as a basis, the world will end one day, not worried about it, because of the laws of nature, namely entropy. The hatred for Israel and Christianity will continue to grow. Nothing will change we have always had storms and always will. We will always have wars, because man is basically selfish
i agree with you. unless maybe the person can't for a medical reason, etc. but other than that, yes. SHOW RESPECT FOR OUR COUNTRY! our brave soldiers are willing to go fight for america and risk their lives and some people in here are to lazy to get of their ass to pledge allegiance to the flag. i think its wrong. i will proudly stand for [inapp20] and do everything i can to support it.
Today a cat passed [inapp1] a busy road. It stood there and was partially injured , then killed by other cars passing over it.My sister cried out emotionally watching this poor animal suffer. I however did not feel anything. Watching a animal die will at bit unpleasant is not something one should show emotion for. The animal itself was feral, it had no owners to care for it. We also show no connection to [inapp20] our relationship is like myself viewing a tree in another Field. I am a wage earner, I have no duty of care to an animal running across the road. It makes sense to feel nothing for [inapp20] as it is another of the many organisms which die and don't effect our lives in any meaningful way.This is not about [inapp20] weather road kill is bad or good for the enviroment, rather my own emotional reaction to seeing a animal die senselessly. I am [inapp20] it is fine to experience no emotion.
The actual leaders of bailed-out firms should be killed by lethal injection, not figureheads or sacrificial lambs. It shouldn't be too hard to figure out who called the shots, even if they've since quit. The moral hazard created by bailouts is that business leaders get to [inapp15] profits while the costs of a crash are borne by the public. That encourages them to take big risks at our expense. Adding the personal risk of death should correct this problem.This would also help balance out inequity in the application of the law. Right now the sword of justice comes down on the poor more than the rich.I don't like the death penalty in general because I don't think it works as a deterrent; people who commit foolish crimes aren't foresightful enough to be thinking about the consequences. But corporate leaders probably ARE.They will think twice before sinking the airship and bailing out with a golden parachute, because they will land on Lady Liberty's sword.
There are hundreds of states on the planet and all of them engage extensively in initiating aggression against the individuals they control. Sometimes state's violence is in response to violence initiated by individuals and then it can be justified. For example – imprisoning a murderer. A lot of the time, it is the state that initiates the violence. Yet most people do [inapp20] the aggression initiated by the state as problematic. For most people a shop robbery is wrong. But taxation is justified on the basis of a "social contract" [inapp20] vague concept.We invent euphemisms to give state action legitimacy. For example we say “drafted” when we could say “slave soldier” or “drug confiscation” when we could say “theft of herbs”. These euphemisms muddy the emotions people feel when they encounter these situations.One day, people will look at our society run by politicians using violence and it will be as incomprehensible to them as Spanish inquisition is to us.
Its quite simple. Men who very wealthy and famous, nevermind if they are also younger and decent-to-good looking, have too much [inapp7] to have sex with other women. They dont even need any game to get sex. Its too easy. Too easy=too much temptation. I believe that less than 50% of men are strong enough to resist this. Of course, there is no actual data to support this, so this may be a crappy CMV.Therefore, when the wives/gfs of these men are taken by surprise, they are being irrational. Its more likely than not that your partner will cheat on you.For this reason, i believe that women such as Tiger Woods ex-wife were being delusional when they married with the expectation of no infidelity.
I believe the word they might be looking for is Hip Hop / youth culture that is not just reserved for blacks. While again, the whole culture itself is not that bad, there are many parts that have stemmed from this culture that are themselves bad for society. For example, a great deal of sexism, homophobia, and racism is perpetuated through rap music and the culture behind it (though this is slowly changing). Another is the inherent disrespect [inapp20] with the culture, [inapp20] overall rudeness. Just look at the hundreds of videos of vine of people just destroying others' property for laughs, or even the knockout videos or the glorification of those who suckerpunch. It's despicable.
Example:Christian A denies carbon dating and fossil records, believes that we are the only intelligent life in all discovered and undiscovered universes, as well as a [inapp8] of other insane stuff.Christian B accepts [inapp11] is true, accepts that the whole concept [inapp14] as portrayed in the bible is archaic and incompatible with the 21st century, but still follows good christian values, believes in god as simply a 'higher being' and believes that they will be rewarded after death for being a good person.Christian A does not *deserve* to be taken seriously, they can still have their beliefs without denying whats scientifically proven, but they choose to be ignorant. Having a religion based on faith is fine, I personally have my own spiritual beliefs, but I dont see how you [inapp20] take the church of the flying spaghetti monster seriously if you take christian fundies seriously.
We are all capable of the horrendous act that Hitler committed or fostered in his life. The right circumstances and societal influences could bring out the same in each of us. I am definitely not supporting any of the atrocities he engaged in. But there is historical perspective that could perhaps explain some of his attitudes. The entire concept of eugenics fed right into his Aryan superiority complex. And [inapp20] is war. People can justify all kinds of horrible things [inapp20] that mode. Again, I am thoroughly disgusted by what he did, but I do not discount the possibility that I am capable of horrible things myself if I do not keep a focus on continually learning and growing and evolving in a compassionate and empathetic manner.
Oil has long outlived its use. There is enough plastic in existence that simply recycling what is unused could supply more plastic. All plastic is recyclable.Battery technology has existed for nearly 10 years now that can give a car up to 400 [inapp14] on a single charge. That exceeds many gas-run vehicles on the road today.All production use oil damages the environment, causes numerous diseases, and is the primary cause of global warming.Oil spills kill hundreds of thousands of animals per year, as they continue to affect the area of the spill decades after it occurred.Oil is the primary interest of the US in the middle-east. As such, it is the cause of numerous wars.
I do not think such a thing should be enforced by law. In certain cases it's necessary to have privacy on the web. However, if you [inapp8] to hide....or are not reconnoitering sh*t, no need [inapp12] your identity. Is it annoying when people, for instance, post sh*t online attacking others but hide their identity? To me it is.
Don't [inapp0] all that "They changed the way we make music" or "They were so deep" crap. I listen to [inapp7] and roll to [inapp8] and roll, not to ponder life's deeper meanings.When I listen to [inapp12] music, my standard of greatness is whether or not this song makes me want to crank my stereo up or not.I can't think of a single Beatles song that I can simply turn on and [inapp20] out to.The Who - [inapp20] down.
Not how I would want to earn my living. BUT, what right do I have to judge what some one else does with their life? I have enough trouble keeping track of ME. When I was younger I might have [inapp13] this question much differently. Life has a way of changing the way you look at it as you mature. I am only responsible for me and I will have to answer for whatever I have or haven't done. Anybody that doesn't think I'm right probably has a few more life experiences before them.
Let's assume that Senator McCain is sincere and actually wants his input in the bailout of the economic crisis in case he should become the big cheese after the November election. Okay, but keep in mind that he has admitted that the economy is not his strong suit, I let him slide on that too.What stops him from giving up just a few hours for one evening to be part of a debate that is very important to his [inapp20] chances?Because of that I feel McCain is running scared which is hurting his chances, he's demonstrating that when it come to crunch time, he'll bail and look for something ele to do
Why? Why go out of your way to take away some ones rights? We have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. For some getting married might be one of the milestones along that pursuit for happiness. If the right to marriage gets taken away, those people who lost the rights might not be truly happy. All I have to ask is, if GLBT community can get [inapp20] taken away, then, Whos Next?
victor frankl was a psychiatrist's and during world war 2 a prisoner in a concentrations field he say that in such a terrible [inapp7] he feels free because he can choose to go insane or [inapp11] calm, not only he feels free, he was free because freedom is choice and he choosepeople can say that [inapp18] is the capacity to do what ever you want bud [inapp20] is a characteristic of freedom, every choose have consequence, i can choose if tomorrow i steal a bank of course the i a m going to jail ( if they cath me XD ) and if you choose a path you should accept the consequence
My wife and I love this place. We take people here all the time. They just changed the nachos from a wonderfully tasty chip to ones that are meh. For a Mexican place you would think they would stay with what works. Hopefully the other locations do not use these sub par chips. We will not be ordering out guac / salsa / and [inapp20] anymore. Why bother,
Some would say that raffles left singapore for a few years and left farquer incharge therefore he negleted us. Imagine SST Ngee Ann Poly and NTU have done so much for us and are considered the founders of us are you trying to imply that because now they are back taking care OF THEIR OWN SCHOOLS. Another good example would be if Lee Hsien Lioeng took a day off for family time would [inapp20] he is not our prime minister anymore? Would you say he is neglecting singapore? He has a life!
it shouldnt be about how we got [inapp2] why are we here.
thats so stupid. physical education teaches kids that it dosent matter if your a nerd or a jock because if theyre all in the same class doing the same thing then theyre all the same in the aspect that they only [inapp13] that class if they put forth effort. and from personal expirence sometimes there is a jock underneath the nerd outside
physical education should be mandatory cuhz 112,000 people have [inapp3] in [inapp3] 2011 so far and it's because of the lack of physical activity and people are becoming obese!!!!
because today lots of students are playing computer games when the school finish. and than students can't get good health and also [inapp7] get serious dieases like cancer because of electromagnetic waves. this [inapp11] because computer have lots of electromagnetic waves.
Because real PE lessons provide chances to people to realize on what they are capable of doing,so it will strengthen the self-esteem leading to them being [inapp8] in their society.
it's the woman's choice. [inapp1] control her. (anyway how do u know she just wouldn't kill herself in attempt to kill her [inapp7] as well?)
Giving up a child has to be one of the most responsible decisions a woman can make [inapp5] life. Have you any idea the responsibility and maturity it takes to make such an important decision?If a woman can not support a child(Either emotionally, physically, or financially) she should have right to [inapp17] give up that child.
It really depends the situation; if a girl/woman gets raped, it's not fair that she has to keep the child. If a young teen has unprotected sex and ends up with a child, that's her [inapp11] for not being prepared.
Pro-lifers want live babies so they can grow up to be dead soldiers, ironic eh?Women are people too, and it should be their [inapp7] what they bring into the world.
its simple, [inapp0] we be able to adapt to different enviroments. Over time we adapted to what suited us best otherwise why arn't we one skin colour, why are there so many types of animals
Yeah, [inapp0] degraded by pornography, but if it's already done, why shouldn't we watch it? We can't stop something that has already happened, so let's just go for it :P
Frankly, if kids didn't dress like whores and drug dealers all the time then it wouldn't be a problem, but since a lot of [inapp8] school districts have to turn to such a thing.The argument of individuality...who cares? That's a [inapp13] bull. Is school the only place these kids go? What is stopping them from going home and putting on different clothes after school? And it isn't the schools job to make sure [inapp20] kid gets to "express their opinion." School is meant to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a night club.
That's really good idea. As i remember every morning i though what was better to wear? It was really problem, i spent quiet a lot of time. I asked my parents to buy new clothes for me, it was happened not rare. I know that [inapp15] thought as me, but it much better if the school has own uniform and everybody has to follow it. First it looks very good, smart. Secondly there is no envy that somebody have really nice skirt or jeans. Every pupil is the same and it would be easy to study, to not think about another things!!
If you want your [inapp1] wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class.Maybe I'm exaggerating.But my [inapp13] is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.
Marriage is between a [inapp1] a woman. It has always been so. If two people want to live in Sin together, I have no problem with that. However, they shouldn't be rewarded with tax breaks. And I sure don't want them to have a platform to spew their garbage and cram it down my kids' throat. Since Homosexuality is a learned sin (think about it) I don't want my kids to learn that it is ok. This public exposure/support of the homosexuals isn't good for morality, and if morality goes, then so does society. (Lord of the Flies)
I already had my say in [inapp2] and we Indians at least managed to learn these mongrel's language and we are pretty good at it. But the rest of you English gimmicks stumble in your own tongue.I am quoting some sush102"Hey its better dnt teach me wats da differnce between chatng nd debatng..... If i start my debate na den u bloody will b 4ced to leave dis site [inapp20] run away...."what crap?"dnt" , "ma" "dis"what kind of [inapp20] is that???It makes no difference what you say but [inapp20] remains that INDIANS are the BEST!!!!
India certainly has d potentials 2 lead d world......in our real world power and [inapp4] doesn't work any moremaybe...................................maybe USA,UK or such other contries are more powerful but India is economically more strong.it is d hub 4 [inapp12] companies.
I'm pro-life based on one major fact.... abortion being used the way it is today.. like a last minute form of birth control. If your too stupid to wear protection, get on the pill, just give [inapp12] up, there are thousands of people who can't have children who'd love to have it.
A growing embryo is considered human with the heartbeats initiating as early as 21st day of conception. So what if we cannot see the human form, it does have the potential to gain one.Around 60% of abortions are performed on never married women. Why can't women give [inapp15] up for [inapp17] instead, even if she is raped. If your [inapp20] does that give you the right to got out and kill someone?
I [inapp0] the [inapp1] the child, who [inapp3] same right to life as the mother
This is not a [inapp1] known fact - Can [inapp3] me to a reference?Or [inapp5] mean that gay _sex_ is helping spread AIDS? In which case gay marriage may help reduce the problem.
I think it all starts earlier than one suspects. I am appalled at the way in which children use the term "spastic" as an insult. What are they learning [inapp9] to be so insensitive? It doesn't get better. I was once in a position where I needed to recruit a typist and I suggested to Human Resources that perhaps this was a job which might be made available to a disabled person who might otherwise find it hard to gain employment. I encountered bafflement. "Any particular disability?" I was asked. I have a son who has been disabled since the age of twelve. He is hoping for a job worthy of his very considerable intellectual skills, but he keeps his disability well concealed when job hunting. He has seen too much of people's attitudes. In many ways, we still live in the jungle.
They can now and here in Florida it is legal for a person to shoot if they feel that they are in danger for their life. And you know what, if someone bashed my [inapp11] down I'd shoot [inapp12] ask questions later. I think this may be very bad for all the police trying to do their jobs. What in Gods' name were they thinking? Some idiot right wingers may think this is OK but heaven help the cops.
I assume you are referring to the entire criminal justise system as the professional group.As in the series Law and Order it involves enforcement as well as the legal profession. Part of [inapp10] is the law makers as well.Public policy is not always easy to define.Power and influence in an ideal democaracy would come from the people but [inapp19] that isn't really true, eoungh money will sway public opinion and buy almost any [inapp20] and swing almost any vote whether it is public or in legistature.I am not sure what you mean by "playing policy roles"The direct enforcers offer direct power. The police and the judges. But those who actually make the laws provide the true power and [inapp20] back to the people with money to buy the influence to change laws. It really all goes back to the rich and powerful.
Violent [inapp0] and child molestation [inapp1] the death penalty, though I'd settle for life sentence.Right now we have sex offender lists to protect the public against these people who have been let out of prison. What kind of sense does this make? We make the lists because they are still dangerous; but if they're dangerous, why are they out of prison?I say, just kill them all. Problem solved.
Lawyers are sly as foxes. They typically only ask questions that they already know the answers to. They use various tactics to get you to say what they want you to say, unless of course the lawyer is defending or representing you. Some lawyers speak in a very demanding voice in an attempt to undermine your confidence and to dispute the [inapp20] of your statements. Beware! I believe the best way to handle this is not to play into this tricky by keeping a cool head, remain calm at all times. If you seem unconfident, you may lose your case.
It matters to [inapp1] us who attended schools where all this was important, have or had parents to whom it was important and have jobs where it is important. If you can get through life without any of those applying to you, then you may well conclude that it is all somewhat irrelevant and [inapp18] you? I think that by anybody's standards it is better to be a good and caring person than one with impeccable spelling and grammar. And having seen your original question, I think that you are worth twenty of those people who are so arrogant and superior about their command of language and who seek to put you in your place. I'd rather have a good hearted neighbour any day than one with impeccable English!
see... it's a little thing called freedom... maybe a grandpa of yours [inapp4] for it... but people are free to talk how they want to talk and write how they want to write... if you don't like it... you don't have to talk to them... or do business at a place that caters to spanish speaking people... I mean in China towns accross the nation for years, Chinese and other asian languages are spoken and advertised...The government has a lot it needs to do before it needs to worry about what language people are speaking... and [inapp20] of your "sort" seem to often say... if you don't like how America is doing it... [inapp20] should leave...
They should be tortured.....when they castrate them they should do it without giving them pain medication. I don't think it's fair [inapp7] get the death penalty all that they "suffer" is a little injection by a lethal shot! When they die they have no worries and then we get to pay for it [inapp18] tax dollars!! The person/family they commited the crime against usually is [inapp20] and suffereing for the rest of their lives! It should be "eye for eye tooth for tooth"
By "white privilege," I mean the idea that [inapp2] people have better off lives than minorities. To me, the assumption that white people live easy, privileged lives is no different from [inapp10] that all black people grew up in the 'hood, [inapp13] gangs, and are lucky to even graduate high school. Not all African-Americans grow up in poverty, and not all [inapp20] people have nice lives. There's also this mentality that if a [inapp20] person is discriminated against (ex:affirmative action,) they somehow "deserve it" because of their "white privilege." No one gets to choose their upbringing, good or bad. Treating anyone differently, black or white, because of what their ancestors did is just wrong.
And the invasion of gaza is unjustified as well as impractical.Its the same as iraq, you dont stop [inapp6] by coming in and fucking peoples lives up, palestinians already hate [inapp10] and terrorising gaza only radicalises people and turns them into hamas militants.Aside from that [inapp15] has shown blatant disregard for civilians lives, 50 israelis have [inapp18] vs 1500 palestinians. That alone should show you who is the aggressor and who is caught in the crossfireThis is not about hamas vs [inapp20] its about the people born in gaza and caught up in it. The invasion is [inapp20] designed to kill civilians and scare gaza into subservience.
At the end of the day governments simply use [inapp3] that a soda tax will reduce obesity, but [inapp6] is its just them being greedy trying to make even more money off the poor and middle class.Soda and sugary drunks is far from the only cause of obesity. Obesity is [inapp17] by a ton of factors that include over eating, lack of exercise, and general change in human behavior. The argument is also proven [inapp20] by the fact that soda has existed long before the current obesity epidemic, and soda has gradually gotten more expensive over the years and consumption hasn't dropped enough to prove that pricing is a huge factorThe comparison to cigarettes and [inapp20] is flawed as soda is not an addictive substance, and in moderation causes no [inapp20] the human body. In constant to cigarettes which even in moderation can be very damaging.
School's are a government run institution, designed for the betterment of it's students.As such it's only fair that schools should provide a free, quality lunch for it's pupils. For three primary reasons: 1. It seems only logical that a public [inapp13] that mandates the pupils be there for an upwards of 7 hours feed them.2. If you want to curb obesity, 3. Not all [inapp20] afford to bring a quality meal to school, have the money to buy one, or have the time to make one in the morning.As a person who just graduated highschool last year in the USA, the school lunches were expensive ($3) and crap, i knew many children whose lunch would consist of chips, candy, and soda, and refused to buy lunch either because they didn't' want to spend the money, or because the lunch was poor in quality.Change my view.
I've read some scientific racism writing and I think many of its claims have no scientific basis. Shouldn't the differences between races be [inapp7] ? People of different origins have different bodies (skeletton, skin color...) why wouldn't they have a different brain ?Note that I don't think any race is superior to the other, just different. Just like the differences between gender doesn't make one superior to another.On another hand I don't want such research to be done because that could be misinterpreted by hateful people and lead to a resurgence of racism.
I [inapp0] should be putting millions into research of doing cool animal combinations. For example: a half gorilla half octopus. Face is similar to an octopus and has 2 legs and 6 wavy arms and its also furry.I don't buy the "don't play god" argument because I'm not [inapp16] god smiting us for creating abominations.Imagine if you could have a turtle with a chicken head just wandering about your house.Sure the research would cost a lot and some animals might get hurt but I really feel the end result would be worth it.
8 years ago I would have ridiculed Americans for allowing celebrities to influence their voting without checking the facts for themselves.Now I have to admit that there is little chance of [inapp10] being avaliable to them via regional news vendors and so this might be a decent plan B.Do what your told America, but by someone marginally smarter than the current guy. Apathy has worked well so far and tv tells you which burger taste best so I guess they know which President is best too.
This is easy, classical music is stagnant, most classical music fans are snobbish, they want to hear exactly how it was performed several centuries ago. They put down so-called "neo-classical"Jazz is always evolving, it is a living art form. It is always adapting the latest music trends-yet remains jazz. Jazz can take Tin Pan Alley music, pop, RnB, soul, hip hop, world music, folklore et al and it is still jazz. Oh yeah sire they are purists but they are a very small group. Jazz is about improvisation, musicians do not play the same song the same way two times, it is different and fresh every time it is playedJazz is a melting pot, it was born in the US of A-New Orleans, made up of elements from Africa, Europe and home grown, jazz is freedom, if you can blow, you're in regardless of your background or ethnicity. jazz is the USA's greatest cultural exportProps to whomever created [inapp20]
With one day Cricket (40 overs) and Twenty20 Cricket (20 overs) taking a hold on the Cricket world, bringing much needed excitement and flair to the game it is time for Test Cricket to step down.If Cricket is to survive as a sport, then we need to get rid of games that last 3 days and don't always have a winner. et rid of the boring whites and boring defensive play. Only the old guard and a tiny fraction of Cricket [inapp20] like this form of Cricket.People would rather pay £40 to go see 20 overs of cricket full of 6's and 4's and lots of wickets, rather than sit there a full day and see one wicket and only singles.If it is to expand and appeal to people then we need excitement and money. Money only comes from entertainment.Test Cricket is dying out, lets whack it on the head to finish it off and bury it quickly to forget about it.Roll on Twenty20!!!
Each religion is in the process spreading their [inapp2] care if they believe from heart.may be thats the reason why most terrorist are converts,may thats the reason why most people those who are converts in christianity are poor people.and they aare shown the bait of money.so wht it is spread of [inapp17] or the head count.i think its the head count.
Termaionater because he is made of full metal and pluse in the movie he said that he can live for milions of years. pluse he can see every thing [inapp9] is dark. All so he he way much smarter that rob cop. Rob [inapp14] he is just hafe human and hafe metal see thats stupied if he gets shout in the mouth he would die. and allso every time he gets hit really bad he will die quicker. but that why the termanater is so much better. Like if he gets shout he wont die at all he looses his own arm he can still walk really fast.
How are you going to enforce it? Stop people in the middle of the road, ask their license and registration, and conduct a breath test? "Sir, you have been randomly selected for breath test, please step outside of the car".Will certainty give counties jobs for police officers, at the expense of tax payers.Cops already doing tests if they suspect you were drinking -- it's not [inapp20] but probable cause.Guess what. if you were drinking and cops do not suspect your drinking habits, it is because your Alcoholic content is below DUI. Some cops don't like the extra effort, and paperwork stopping people for DUI. Do you think [inapp20] testing will solve this problem?
Indeed, why?It's mere presence should be as unusual as a 1 in 10 million genetic mutation. It should not be a part of what we are. We are the by product (let us say) of millions of years [inapp12] in a world of chance that has no God. All of physics and chemistry teaches us that everything on one side of an equation is represented in another form on the other side of the equation. In this caseNo God plus No God plus No God throught millions of years [inapp20] equals a [inapp20] with a NEAR universal pursuit of God. How did [inapp20] in the equation?
it had a good plot. it was your typical revenge story, but they didn't reveal that [inapp5] end. [inapp6] a good twist. and underlying it all, [inapp9] somewhat of a moral. if you are going to complain about the audio as your reason for it being a bad movie then you need to [inapp18] your pretentious pedestal and hang out with the rest of humanity.
Have not been to a Sizzler in decades, but the quality of food and service at this location was pretty spot on. The salad and soup bar and ice cream was only $6.49 at lunch (2 bucks more if you want taco/hot bar which looked very average). They had four soups and the best of the two I tried was the Chicken rice gone wild, which was loaded with stuff. French onion was decent too (add croutons) and two other creamier soups were untried. The salad bar was well stocked and had every veggie you possible could have needed, plus endless slices (still in the shell) of avocado which is a great addition. Plus, there is a waitress who refills drinks and brings you your [inapp20] famous cheese toast or rolls or in my case both and you can get more of either. The cheese toast is pretty addicting. Most customers speak spanish, but that is just the area and the food is well worth the price if you are around this [inapp20] of the woods.
PROS: Room cost roughly $60.00 per night. Room was very clean and very modern.CONS: Front desk is a joke! Check in takes about a half an hour, called down for extra towels & was on hold for ten mins before I gave up. Will stay again if I have no other choice but make sure I have everything I need before leaving the front desk as [inapp20] get ahold of them after check in.
Is porn good for ur health ?No it isnot opponents say that porn doont have a serious effects on health. however [inapp7] have shown that porn and practice it can damage ur health slowly especially ur immune system . sooner or later thos who do porn in thier relationships definitely they donot have good health as others . [inapp19] a key question . somke is bad for u . somkers feel good when they smoke but smoke 100% leads to thier death and porn have the same influence on the healthi think that smoke is better than porn in facr both of them are extremely bad for u
firefox is so bloated now. It uses way more memory. Once everyone buys a new PC, and gets IE7, they'll have no excuse to switch to firefox. FireFox better [inapp9] act together. They are becoming more and more like Mozillia who got got gutted from a bloated Netscape.FireFox needs to get gutted. It shouldn't take all my system's memory to use a web browser.
Unfortunately, most of what sabrejimmy says is a [inapp2] crap.This is what makes these kinds of debates pointless. You have some idiot creationists, who don't understand anything about science.sabrejimmy hasn't attempted to learn anything from this debate. He continues to ask ridiculous questions.Personally, I think I will have to ignore his future posts. Intelligent debate is satisfying, but this isn't.
I call the god that creationists believe in the "God of the Gaps." Early man's understanding of the universe was extremely limited. People did not know that earthquakes were caused by tectonic plates shifting. Therefore the idea of earthquakes being the work of an angry deity seemed logical, but man's understanding of the universe has grown significantly. We now know that current species came to be from [inapp20] years of evolution. Supporting [inapp20] holding humanity back. We need to accept the facts and let religion fade away.
No porn is not wrong. As an [inapp2] noun, it cannot be wrong.
The question is: who has the right to prohibit it? Government? Why would [inapp4] any pressing need at all for the state to outlaw pornography? Look at Europe- they're cool with pretty much everything. I don't see any moral depravity in Europe, do you?
Bottled water should be only used for emergencies weather it be natural or human disaster. To help people in need and not pollute in the environment and harm habitats by dumping in the ocean or in landfills. Plastic doesn't decompose so in [inapp14] do not use on for emergencies.
God [inapp0] water bottles for a reason. Because its good.
plastic water bottles all day every day guys, without those we could comfortabley walk around the block with a safe suply of water in our [inapp8]
I'd like to point out how few disputs there are on the Christian side, that's cuz free [inapp5] people dont need to convince other's. We know that there isn't a god, and that its up to us to make our lives.
For reasons that should be [inapp1] obvious, and which I would assume have been [inapp4] fleshed out by others involved.
There is only one [inapp1] which I believe abortion is okay.If a mother is incapable of giving birth to the child, and attempting it might kill her, I believe abortion is sad, but necessary.Otherwise, no one has the right to kill a child, born or unborn.
My one question...Why is it we argue for the "right" to kill the [inapp4] when the government is [inapp6] our real rights?
a PE teachers job must be really easy. [inapp2] need to learn anything, all they have to [inapp6] yell at kids for an hour.
You cannot choose someone's lifestyle because you don't agree with it. You cannot call someone's lifestyle a "choice" when you are not that person and know [inapp8] was not a "choice."
Obviously everybody wants to say that they would help mankind, the world or save the city, but only a small percent of people would actually do this. I honestly would like to help mankind. I would like [inapp12] the world, but I'm posting under personal pursuit because I do [inapp16] what I would do in one of these situations.Anyway, if people did believe in the advancement of the common good all of the economical cars and factories wouldn't just now be made. These inventions would [inapp20] out as soon as the theory of global warming came out.
First of all, the ACLU would [inapp2] to do with this case. They generally only take cases involving the government infringing on people's civil liberties.Second of all, where's your source for this case? You have a few specific details, so surely you must have some news story or a link of some kind to more information? I have a hard time [inapp20] your statement.Third of all, the answer to your [inapp20] "no."
I don't know - I always call my electrician to help fix my plumbing.Perhaps the defense lawyer is more of a general [inapp7] attorney that works on many different kinds of cases. Or, perhaps he (or your husband) is an idiot.Worst case [inapp14] - he's trying [inapp15] the ability to claim inadequate representation if you kick him around in court.
If you live in Michigan they will. Michigan has zero tolerance for underage drinking.-I just thought I would update this for all you who have chastised her for drinking and driving. No where [inapp11] question does it say she was driving!!! If she had been drinking and driving she would have gotten more than just a ticket for minor in possesion. Some states will [inapp20] a minors driving license just for being in possesion of alcohol even when they are not in a vehicle.
Do you mean [inapp1] with minors or minors [inapp3] with each other?If it involves a hot woman and a male minor then [inapp8] If its a guy and a [inapp10] minor than it badIf its two minors together than the laws should be less harsh than they are nowA good example would be when a hot teacher [inapp20] jail for doing it with a male student. For what? Making him one of the luckiest guys alive?
Since stem [inapp0] are abundant in the [inapp2] remaining in the umbilical cord after delivery, there does not need to be a moral trade off... I favour harvesting of stem [inapp10] from donated cord [inapp11] and see no reason at all why embryonic [inapp14] are needed at all in order to do the research that holds such incredible promise.Added after reading the answer below...WOW! Now, this is interesting...I am pro choice and the person below is clearly not, and yet on [inapp20] we are in agreement... If a "Pro Lifer" and a "Pro Choice Advocate" are both saying, in essence, "Hey, you don't need to create embroyos for this purpose, there is another perfectly viable source of [inapp20] cells, use it." we have to be right, because usually we probably wouldn't be able to agree that water is wet.
i think to make murder punishable by murder is a joke, what is the difference between the criminal and the law if both are commiting murder. also if i were facing life in prison i would much prefer the death penalty and im sure many [inapp15] death row see it that way, fortunatly in [inapp18] we abolished the death penalty long ago and now killers have to live with their nightmares for the rest of their lives rather than getting an easy way out. we are supposed to be promoting modern [inapp20] western values to the rest of the world but it is not very good when the wests leading nation itself cannot follow these ideals
Is this a question, or a US bashing, I'm not sure. I often ask myself that same question though. The most honest answer might be because we can control our technology, and we have the power [inapp12] proliferation too because we see it as a danger. In general, it's probobly not a good idea for every Tom, Dick, and Harry to have Atom bombs. Do you really think nothing bad would happen if every country had enough bombs to destroy the planet? Yea that would be swell. I do have to admit there is a certain irony to the United States being so controling about nukes. We say we can't trust others to have them, but who's the ONLY county crazy enough in the [inapp20] the world to actually use one... Yep.
I certainly don't fear "the competition"...Besides the fact that my husband gets it good at home, most of the prostitutes I've seen are FAR from "very hot chick"...Most of them are drug addicted skanks who stopped trying to have any other skills when they realized they [inapp15] money off their own twat.Personally, I believe that it should be legalized, as this removes much of the mystique and sordidness from the whole situation. Also, in most places where it's legal, they're tested for diseases on a regular basis, which obviously solves a major problem.
We're born, we live, we die. These are the constants in our life. We know that [inapp5] are going to happen. So what is the point of being motivated to do anything? Why should I work a terrible job that I have no interest in? Why should I bother to keep in touch with people? I am in a position right now where I am between jobs, and in a general transition phase in my life. Dealing with societal strife is meaningless. I should just withdraw from society and live out my days surrounded by cats or something. CMV._____
Today I opened the [inapp1] for a [inapp2] and got screamed at, at 8 in the morning. Certainly changes need to be made but not in the way it's being approached now. I don't think I've heard one coherent argument. Again, I completely support equality but the beating down of every make you come across surely isn't the best way to accomplish things. It's not like I don't support the movement, I just don't fully understand it (in terms of how the goal is being achieved). And every person I've come across supporting it has been mean spirited and a bit of an assholeI guess what I'm really looking for is proof of what progress is being made recently, or how the aggressiveness pays off. Thanks in advance for any light that can be shed
Look at the vitality of Florida's major metropolitan areas. They're at the top of technology, trade and commerce, and entertainment. I've been in this [inapp8] my entre life, and even though we took a battering economy wise, it's disheartening. I know why my friends keep leaving the area, since it's nothing more than God's waiting room. To many sticks in the mud, you know? Tourism is an economic driver, bit it shouldn't be the only one.For the love of Pete, change my view before 2015! That may be my opportunity to hop off to Tampa Bay should I have the means to do so.
Increasingly over the last decade the police in America have become more and more aggressive and abusive of their powers. Almost daily we hear of police shooting and killing unarmed and unthreatening citizens along with animals. Most times these cops are given a slap on the wrist or paid leave at worst. I understand that they serve a vital function in our society, but has become evident that they are abusing that trust. In many places they have tried to Institute personally mounted cameras which have been [inapp20] lower incidents and [inapp20] abuse claims, yet police departments have been adamant against implementation. This leads me to believe that they [inapp20] to hide criminal activity and widespread systemic abuse. If i smoke marijuana I am infinitely more prone to danger from police then from anyone or anything else. And with the increasing militarization this threat is ever increasing.
Duchamp's Fountain questioned the status quo. The popular consensus is that it is an early and successful example of asking the question, "what is art". But hasn't almost all installation art since then been Duchamp's Fountain over and over again. A tent in a gallery, a dirty bed in a gallery, a shed in a gallery etc etc.Almost all contemporary installation art is criminally dull and boring. The 100th attempt at asking the question 'what is art' just leaves me dripping with apathy. The greatest crime that Art can commit is to be boring. Just sitting there, letting out a heavy sigh [inapp20] walk by. All the boring toys end up at the bottom of the toy box. But with modern art installations in museums, it's the opposite. They're proudly put on display.I wish this kind of art didn't have the reputation of an STD in England, but it does.
The workers in China, even if [inapp2] paid only pennies, clearly need the money. My understanding (which I admit is limited) is that unless a governing body makes an active effort to relieve poverty, the outsourcing of American projects to China is a necessary thing so that the families/people of China can scrape by. If a family suddenly loses their jobs, they can no longer afford to eat or pay rent or buy clothes. Additionally, if outsourcing was removed, prices all around the world would increase dramatically, affecting people currently living on the brink of poverty themselves. Workers who have the jobs that robots would replace would again have the same issue as those in China-so while I don't agree with paying children or other adults pennies for hard labor, I think it's the best way to maintain the fragile balance we have. Improve first, then change what can be changed.
* Nobody should take a drug [inapp2] understand the effects of, and removing drug stigma is the first step to increasing peoples education on the subject.* Nobody should be judged differently to a drinker for preferring LSD or MDMA. Addictive [inapp13] should be considered more akin to tobacco: Definitely a bad habit to start, and generally not worth trying at all.* Everybody should be able to seek help for addiction without worrying about criminal charges. * Everybody should be able to buy govt approved, pure drugs and know what they're taking.* Everyone knows [inapp20] on drugs is a failure. Its fine if you dont think people should be able to do [inapp20] but you cant say your solution is prohibition but I know I guy [inapp20] get me some [inapp20] who knows a [inapp20] can get me some acid who knows a [inapp20] can get me some meth.Squares would not believe how easy it actually is to buy hard drugs.
Yes. It is safer than alcohol, its nearly impossible to overdose on, and if it was legal it would be easier to regulate. A great example of this would be prohibition: when it was illegal, people still did it (as they do with weed) and it cost a lot of police force to crack down on speakeasies (like they do with weed houses) that could have been used to solve more pressing cases like who shot Mr. Burns and who took the last donut. When Prohibition was removed, organization returned to [inapp20] well.
There's really no debate here, but no one checks the forums and i want this to get some attention.This website has become a stagnant waste. There is almost no intellectual stimualation anymore. The lack of quality debates is almost smothered by the lack of general participation.Its been weeks since i actually learned something or read something worthwhile here and that really needs to change. It used to be that i couldn't stay away from this site, now i have to make an effort just to spend a couple minutes every couple of days logged in.This needs to change. So i'm going to make an effort to have a plethora of debates (about 5 a week) and they'll start with W.U.C (Wake Up Convinceme) and they'll cover a range of political, social, and moral issues that i feel are stimulating and not discussed enough to maybe bring [inapp20] back.Wake Up Convinceme!
This debate isn't about whether kids should eat candy, but whether governments should [inapp4] ads for kids that portray candy-eating as good.Its legal for kids to eat candy, so [inapp9] it be illegal for people to tell kids they should eat it? Besides, kids naturally like sweets and the ads only convince them to choose one brand over another, not to start eating candy.We need to bring responsibility back to the parents instead of letting them use the government to babysit for them.This should be a no-brainer for anyone who claims to value freedom.
Hitler invaded Poland in 1932 and the world turned against Germany. In fact, there are dozens if cases in the last 100 years where countries have invaded other nations and the world has [inapp11] uproar and rose up against it. Yet some dumb Texan does it and gets away with it.Try him for war crimes, along with Tony Blair and have them both executed or imprisoned.
Well truth be told, [inapp1] different for each [inapp3] of us. My [inapp4] that when I flush the toliet the water goes counter clockwise, but for someone in Brazil their [inapp11] it goes clockwise. Who is right, well in a sense we both are, scenarios define truths.Then again I could give the typical Christian answer and say Jesus is truth, The Way, the Truth and the Life. LOL
We all know that guys just want to get some ass to impress their friends and show off that they got some...soon after the guy will leave the [inapp9] after he bangs her and goes off to someone else and then so on. Well all know that when he comes down to it guys pressure their [inapp18] to have sex when they aren't [inapp20] and if the guy wants it really bad he'l break up with the [inapp20] and go out with someone [inapp20] that will give him some so he can feel sastified and that doesn't [inapp20] feel confident about themselves and it makes the guy a low selfish asshole.
We should not have to pay for education as it is vital for society to function. If people are [inapp6] afford the price of education there are consequences that will occur; such as many children's futures will disintegrate. Education is what gives people the [inapp15] achieve goals and successfullness; What right has anyone got to refuse to educate someone simply because they are [inapp20] provide the funds required?MJ
I think it's wrong, It goes against [inapp2] and those girls are under aged and abused. It's also really sick in a way, what freak would film people having sex?! I don't get it. I don't see what's so good about it, if you want sexual entertainment, masturbate or something.
*If [inapp0] true....How come people aren't still evolving?
1. why is creation not science?2. [inapp2] this classified under the religion category?3. you disillusioned ppl think you look like monkeys?
Hey IE has the best [inapp1] interface in the world, so why shouldn't you welcome those little cute [inapp6] by sticking with the M$ IE?
I don't think a mother should have the [inapp2] kill her child. But I think she does have the choice of whether a fetus should be considered a human being. A fetus with a nervous system much less [inapp13] than that of a cow should not have greater rights than a cow.
Here's a story for you from a few years back. A nine year old [inapp4] living in poverty in South America was [inapp7] by her step dad, and got pregnant with twins. Her family knew that she would die in childbirth, but she was not allowed to get an abortion because they were devout catholics. Both her and her two children died. That's three lives lost. One of those lives actually knew what life was.
Here's an interesting thought for [inapp1] you who believe "life" begins at conception rather than birth... America grants citizenship to people "born" in the United States, but not to those conceived here.Perhaps if you truly believe life begins at [inapp13] and that is a full person with rights to life, then we should also grant citizenship to that person, no?
all i have to say on this [inapp2] that there is actual [inapp4] support evolution!!
How come people aren't still evolving?How are you so sure we are not?Could [inapp4] show some evidence that we are NOT evolving? And dont say, because we would notice if we were.Solid varifiable evidence if your key to proving your point.
OK no and yes I think p.e should be education which is teaching students how to eat right and live a healthy life style not making a fat kid run 10 laps around a track but showing them that eating right and exercise can BE FUN not having an obese child being [inapp17] because they can't run as fast as someone else. That is what physical education could be real EDUCATION. Students should not feel bad if they can't run a 5k or do 20 push ups
I don't think that he (an old man) killed his exwife and her friend. But this book (which is in extremely poor taste, damn offensive) [inapp8] pitiful attempt to convince an overhelming majority that he is innocent. I think he has lost his mind and since he lost his civil court case, the revenue from his book and other gain ventures should be garnished to pay the restitution that he owes.
It happens all over the world, even bad countries aren't held accountable.Such as [inapp4] for instance in its occupation of Palestinian lands since 1967. Israel was caught breaking the law (occupying another people's land) [inapp11] it that it was protected by the US (through Veto Power) and not militarily kicked out like any other normal country would have been? (eg. Iraq out of Kuwait etc.)So in conclusion, the proper answer to your good question would be that the world isn't fair and just because some people have GUNS and "protection", (like some states have BIG GUNS and "protection"), the law is lenient with them.Luv ya! :)Bye Bye
No, we wouldn't have to factor in the unwanted people if legs would be kept closed and there plenty of people [inapp7] but can't have. If self control was practiced we would have a lot less trouble with this topic. There are the few [inapp15] raped and whatever the other excuses are but there is [inapp19] for that and as for health...my child has a right to live more than I do...abortion isn't really great for a woman's health either ya know?
the liberal demacrates have made it ok to do all these things. If, in some maraculus way, [inapp5] or alchahal became band, they would IMMIDIATELY demand that the law is "unconstitutional" i heard that they took out the picture of George washington praying out of a school because they said that it was "unconstitutional". HES OUR FOUNDING FATHER! And they just took his picture out because they thought it was suggeting the christian values in the school. But they teach the kids about hinduism and judisum, but when it comes to christianity, ITS ILLEAGAL to teach the kids about that. And INstead of trying to keep kids out of sex, THEY ARE HANDING OUT CONDOMS, and trying to "encourge" the mto safe. I agree, its twisted.
If that is the entire story then that outcome is completely bogus. There is NOTHING wrong with touching another person on the head, shoulder, leg, back, etc. There is only something wrong when a person touches a "bad" place, which CLEARLY was not happening and was not going to happen in the middle of the street. What should have happened? The parents should have gotten a lecture on teaching their daughter. The daughter should have gotten a lecture on not running into the street. And the man should have gotten a lecture on smartening up in our lawsuit and sex-crime crazed society. There was no need for any trials or arrests. And how is someone who was NOT CONVICTED (ie: innocent) of a crime forced to register as a sex offender? That simply doesn't [inapp20] sense at all.
Oh please give it up and try to get something accomplished other than this useless pursuit. The [inapp5] of getting marijuanna legalized is slim...well at least the way things are going now. Banning smoking here and there, how things are cooked, what you can and can not say...we are in the "control your [inapp17] shape in mean for your own good" nanny state of mind now.
Get a job. Your ex has a child or children to support. How [inapp4] expect them to do it and why should they carry your responsibility for it as well? GET A JOB!~ Spoken as the ex who is owed a lot of bucks and know how hard it is when a [inapp17] doesn't pay what he owes.Are you my ex? If you are, they are looking for you.....Best Wishes,Sue
What difference would there be? Violent career criminals will continue to be released back into society to make room for nonviolent first-time offenders like deadbeat dads (how [inapp9] pay child support in prison?), drunk drivers with multiple misdemeanor convictions (but no accidents), recreational marijuana users caught with a single joint in their possession, scam artists who prey on the wealthy, etc. Whoever builds them, prisons should be for the long-term incarceration of major drug dealers, robbers, rapists, and murderers in order to protect society from these violent sociopaths.
Well, for one thing, Wal-Mart has one of the worst ratings in terms of how they treat their employees. I know people who boycott them and have encouraged me to do likewise.They are not like Costco at all.Why would Californians want to encourage a store to treat its peopel poorly?Why would they want to pay when the full-timers get cut back to part-time, lose their bennies, and go on Medicaid and use state-supported supplemental insurance plans (I'm assuming; I'm from NY)?Why would they want the related stress [inapp20] with the anger and worthless feelings of being in such an environment so many hours a week?Why would they want them around at all?
Since it's [inapp0] offer equity in a company via a Kickstarter, what's the point of funding one? It's basically a charitable donation to a for-profit company, or a gamble that you can't win - you'll never receive anything more than you put in, but you are quite likely to receive nothing at all in return for your investment. The only benefit I can see is that if there's some idea out there that was so revolutionary that it could change the world, if only it had the proper funding - but if it was that good, why didn't some big corporation buy it already? So it's probably just snake oil. I really can't see any rational reason to [inapp20] a Kickstarter; the only reason I can see to do so is because of an emotional attachment to whatever product is being developed, and a fear that if one does not [inapp20] it, the product will never see the light of day.
I believe there is a stigma in society toward marijuana despite the fact that usage of more dangerous drugs like alcohol and tobacco are socially acceptable. In fact, many [inapp9] believe caffeine [inapp10] even sugar are more dangerous than marijuana.This societal "norm" is the only reason that marijuana is illegal, and not allowed for many employees even in states where it is legal (Colorado and Washington). Alcohol and [inapp20] have hugely negative effects on our [inapp20] a whole, but going out to get a drink, or just having some beers while watching the game, are some of the most common things done either to meet people or with people you're already friends with. CMV.
My vote is for PROMOTING COMPLEX SELF-ORGANIZING MATTER as our ultimate purpose. CSOM is a rarity in this universe and it needs our help. We could shoot rockets to mars loaded with millions of types of microbes in the hope that some would survive and spread. Then hit the oceanic moons.As stupid as that plan may be, it's way better than shuffling along with no species-level goal (other than the core goal of survival). If we just measure ourselves by how efficiently we turn food into people, as nature wills, we'll miss our chance at grandeur. Humankind isn't going to be around forever. We need to do something really excellent before we go extinct.Religions offer goals but [inapp20] so many simple things wrong that they can't be trusted. Their goofy ideas should be ignored.Please share your ideas for what Humanity's Ultimate Goal should be.
There should be no "freedom of religion" because religion is a [inapp3] concept- it's like having the freedom to use whatever perpetual motion machine you prefer. Because those are not real, guaranteeing that right is useless and wasteful.Worse, it subtly legitimizes it. If the constitution really made a point of letting people choose their own perpetual motion machines, many more people would take that idea seriously than otherwise would, to the point where it would seem patriotic to have a preference.Freedom of religion is not a right anyone should be proud to have. It should be forgotten and ignored, like a clunky relic.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Atheism is the absence of religion, not a form of religion, so as a non-believer I need no religious liberties.
If an employer chooses to pay the minimum wage required by law, how can he expect more than what is required? Especially when the job actually requires some skill or intellect in the first place. **Employer** "Can you give 110% when working?" **Employee** "Are you going to pay me 10% extra?". **Employer** "No." **Employee** "There's your answer then". **This whole argument is based on those who are only in minimum wage employment for money, it doesn't [inapp20] if it's an apprenticeship or internship etc****EDIT: There is no chance for promotion or raise in bar work, waiting or store retail, these are the minimum wage jobs I speak of.**
EXCUSE ME! wow someone is very agressive...me? nah I tell the truth...17 years old...very athletic...joined the army reserves recently and I'm a [inapp7] A student who might occaisonally recieve a B+...so I'm not retarded, which I think accusing people of being retards is a very rude thing to say because retardation is an unfortunaste thing to happen to any person and there are actual retards out there, and I'm entering my senior year of high school meaning i haven't dropped out...and since I'm active and very athletic I'm not a [inapp20] fat ass...thank you very much!
I [inapp0] should. Think about it. There are innocent people in Darfur who are being slayn without mercy, and we are letting it happen. Consider this: if there was group of terrorists in our homeland, then wouldn't you want help? It's the same [inapp14] for the people in Darfur, they want help, but they aren't getting it.Also, if we lend a helping hand, then it will put in a good word for the US.
I think the consequences are fine. People having to register as sex offenders, serving jail time, paying fines, etc.. These [inapp6] were [inapp7] for actual pedophiles. If teens and younger people who so-called "don't deserve it" are being subject to this as well, then they do [inapp15] it, for the reason that they choose to act like these criminals, and they need to be taught a lesson. Things are being taken for granted too much within this generation.
As a Catholic i have to say that it should be illegal. Because it is against my religion to kill innocent babies. In the Catholic church once the egg is fertilized it is considered a baby. So i think killing a [inapp13] and it not having a choice should be illegal and you should go to jail.From other religions it might be against your religion.but i still believe that it should be illegal.If you know you can't support your [inapp20] you should put it up for adoption.I also think that the government should be putting more money into [inapp20] agencies and less into seniors.I know that seniors have been alive and been important to our lives, but we have to care more about the children. We have to care more about our future.If someone was [inapp20] or it was incest they should still have the baby, i mean it is still a live and it still a baby.~Just my opinion~
Love is nothing more then a chemical reaction in the brain. So who is to say that teens can't fall in love? Atleast for a period of time. Look at adults. Some of them fall in love, get married, and then divorce. It is the same thing with teens only slightly different. Love comes a while after [inapp19] together.I can agree with an argue that says [inapp20] only interested in each other for a while and then the attraction decreases into nothing. The few that do stay together after that initial reaction fades. Who is to say that it isn't love? Who is to say that teens [inapp20] young to feel that way?
This debate to me, has no moral. Most MEDC's are looking to bring equality for men and women and here we are, looking at women have [inapp8] children. Children choose in the court or in an out of court statement who they would like to live with. If the mother is in a mental state then who is she [inapp20] children to be somebody one day. Maybe you should say that in most cases children opt to live with mothers, but there are some cases were fathers step in and personally, i think they MUST STEP IN.
Well it all pretty much depends....Like if [inapp2] someone that deserved it well it would still be scary to sleep with them so this a maybe / maybe not situation... So yeah [inapp11] to sure
India has the potential to lead because it has the second largest man power n [inapp5] largest army in the world n it is a country full of hopes n aspirations n for Indians nothing is impossible, n we r proud to be Indians n we will lead the world n be the [inapp17] of the world in every manner. even 34% [inapp20] in NASA are Indians.
Right Now, In My opinion to be fatherless. Trust me I Went through it. Sometimes I wish I Had a Lousy Father but Yet Not having A Father is so much better. It's been Eighteen Years since I've seen my Father but if he doesn't care then [inapp15] I? If he wanted to be in My life he could've been in my life. But being Fatherless is not bad because I have My Mother and To me that's My Father. I would rather have a Father who want to pay attention to me and actually be supportive of me.
i think we should have gym because [inapp2] FAT and tubby! its not ok for kids to get fat and tubby!!!!!
It's not yours, nor anyone else's but the person involved's decision as to whether or [inapp5] want an abortion. This is such an overblown issue that people on both sides are being killed over it--it's ridiculous, and this needs to be left alone.
GO TV!!!!!! GO TV!!!!TV will win [inapp2] LOLTV is great [inapp3] anything
Banning plastic bottled water would be a huge mistake in this very moment. More than a million people in the United States purchase bottled [inapp8] day which is helping the economy [inapp10] out of this recession we are in. maybe not in a big way but every kid of help counts! Bottled water also only makes less then 1&#xof; the worlds wastes and can be recycled! According to the National Association for PET Container resources, PET water bottles are no the most recycled container in curb side programs by weight and by number!http://www.nestlewaterscorporate.com/bottled_water_things_to_know/Video/index.html?@videoList.featured=31101711001
Why [inapp0] about a U.S. decision when you are in Canada?
indian culture,,and languages are established 2000yrs ago where [inapp2] are finding there languags
i think there is no doubt on [inapp2] India has [inapp3] lead the world.
I'm sad to see the way this turned out. With not so little respect and so much spamming. I choose atheism over a Christianity because their is not enough [inapp9] soothe my curiosity. Christianity raises too many questions that it never answers.
Notmymuse,Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one.I [inapp3] to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument).Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity.Once you have done this, disprove all other religions.-Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.
there is no god. Science has proven it. It was just an excuse made up [inapp5] from simplier times didnt have to think to hard on those big questions.
all [inapp0] proves is that the internet is full of conceded, stuck up, narcissistic, atheists who are [inapp6] bigoted and intolerant of other peoples beliefs and cant leave people alone to worship or not worship as they chose athieists are biggots plain and simple
Science attests to the existence of God, its only a question of [inapp4] at this point.
Christianity, because I always root for the underdog. The membership of the atheist [inapp4] way bigger. Just look at the congregations of both.
Because if the child is young they [inapp2] whats wrong and whats right the parent needs to teach the child from whats wrong and from whats right
Nobody has the right to tell you what to do with your body, but if that which you [inapp6] to rid off moves away at the first sign of pain, without you feeling it, then "that" is no longer yours, since it feels outside your own.
Definately, the egg and spoon race is a wicked idea! And maybe we should have the royal family breed up a few more uinterbred little [inapp8] partake in the warfare. Imagine them up against the vodka drinking russians.I reckon there would be <if there were no ewapons> less control over the masses - wich has to be a good thing. And there would simply be calm and not so calm areas of the world. There'd be little communes, and then gang rivaled cities. But at least all the fighting nobheads would kill themselves in one place, and the sophisticated calm people wouldn't have to pay for it.
I don't think it's at all charitable of you to donate your old clothes that you no longer [inapp6] then [inapp7] get financial compensation ie a tax write off in return. Do you even know the meaning of charitable? P.S. Why don't you sell the clothing to some homeless 'street' people? They have money from begging and can probably [inapp20] a meal or two to buy some clothes. (Just a thought)
Is it legal to push your religeon on those that dont believe in it?!?!?! I think that answers your question. Better yet - if it was Islam they were pushing in school, would you want your child present???Not only is it moral to remove religeon from schools, it should be mandatory. Children [inapp17] school to LEARN, not to pray, not to learn about God. God cant get you a job or pay your bills. If you insist on God being present in schools, send your children to the seminary for an education.
well strike the 3rd answer down dude.false imprisonment is something that happens more than you think especially in states that do not have discovery laws .and in my opinon they do not have those laws for the simple reason they want to be able to railroad the poor and innocent and "falsely Imprison"them.The southern states ars real good about that.as long as there is no discoverly then the prosecution can hide facts that downright prove the charged person is innocent.And yes they knowingly do this just to embellish their conviction record to help futher their careers down the road and the part that kills me is not only are these low lifes still able to sleep but,the Law lets them get away with it and when it is,(years later usually)discovered there is nothing the innocent person can [inapp20] get back the freedom that was taken from him.
When you [inapp0] necessary requirements [inapp2] mean that as long as they are not felons (since felons cannot vote period)? Well either way, yes and no. Obviously there are many criminals out there that do not care about the country's ethics and they abuse it over and over over. Those criminals should never be allowed to vote. On the other hand, there are those that are truly reformed and [inapp20] a chance to be an upstanding citizen again. For example, if someone has a record for protesting [inapp20] and starting chaos for a good cause, then he/she is hardly a menace to society. Over time that person can mature and learn to channel his/her views in a positive. That doesn't mean they should not be allowed to vote. On the hand, a criminal who has raped, killed, committed hate crimes against different races, etc. should NOT be able to--especially if they are [inapp20] offenders.
The U.S. (so the politicians believe) cannot afford NOT to be friendly to China - a huge emerging market, producers of low-cost consumer products, etc. So even though the Chinese are just as anti-democratic as the Cubans, even though the Chinese [inapp13] have a more horrific human rights record than Castro's Cuba, even though they meddle and interfere with Bush's interests in Central Asia, we give them a [inapp20] because we need China as much as China needs us.Cuba, on the other hand, has very little to offer economically. So we can afford to play the bully, to assert our Monroe Doctrine dominance over the hemisphere and freeze out the Cubans in the hopes that Castro (or, more likely, the guy who comes after him) will fall from power and we can go back to making Cuba the pro-U.S. cheap-sugar-and-smokes satellite that it was for decades.
Our constitutional right to privacy was definitely negated in this situation. If the government suspects someone of having terroristic capabilities, I do not think it would be too hard for them to get a warrant to eavesdrop the legal way. Bush is just trying cover his butts, as well as other members of our government are doing likewise. There are many [inapp20] theories floating around concerning Bush and a few other members of our government, I think it is time the people of this nation take our government back, too many "actors" in power with selfish intentions!
Scott Peterson was [inapp1] juxtapostion to OJ. He wasn't a celebrity, he was an "everyman." Like OJ, he killed the mother of his children. The similarities stop there. He and Laci, were nice looking so the TV images were good. We watched it for the same reason we watched Michael Douglas and Glen Close in Fatal Attraction. Scott is just an average white guy. As with most people who have an affair, particularly when the wife is [inapp20] pregnant, his version of reality went off the reservation. It was a warning sign to the rest of us. 1) Don't lose sight of reality and think that life will be great after you kill your pregnant wife and hook up with the psycho-chic who was f**king you while your wife was pregnant. 2) If you are an average [inapp20] guy, you do not [inapp20] for a crime like OJ got off. It still seems that a black celebrity can work his celebrity magic on a jury - right Michael?
Sure lets substitute one form of discrimination for another good idea. Now instead of being proud of what they accomplished they will always know they didnt have to work as hard as other people because they were given positions. I think reverse descrimination fuels a new type of racism. I [inapp16] people that got into college with low test scores/gpa just beacause of their race. And on top of that [inapp20] money for being their. So congradulation R.D. you have made me into a racist.
Blame the sanitation workers who fought for better wages, benefits, etc. instead of fighting for an education. Blame the unions, and [inapp7] the employers for falling for their diatribe.Americans are doing themselves out of jobs. Don't point a finger at immigrants or the employers.Where else can uneducated people who do not fit well within society find work at $20 an hour with health insurance, vacation and paid sick days?
annie redI am unsure about religion and I am a woman. I have yet to hear a logical reason why abortion should be allowed at [inapp8] for any reason other than [inapp10] the Mother's life. Partial birth abortion is not only murder. It is murder by torture. Stop stereotyping members of the pro-life movement.By the way. Why do liberals assume that conservatives have been brainwashed into their beliefs? Has it never occured to you that the asker has already looked at all [inapp20] the issue?Pro-choice [inapp20] are just as biased as pro-life doctors.
I am not saying all are, there are many with mental or physical health problems, or and extremely bad start in life. However the majority of poor Americans are content, and do not want to have to work, or go to college, or put the time in required to move up in society. I come from a poor family [inapp19] in college now, and I feel lazy allot of the time, I almost feel like I am entitled to sit around and play video games all day, but I have to remind myself that the world humans created does not work that way, that we must work for everything we get. I feel that the society we have created has made us soft, people in 3rd world countries work their whole lives [inapp20] survive, but we have grown up on video games and easy high school. Change my view!
One morning I was in a rush. I had to take a piss, so I decided to multi-task by brushing my teeth while I pissed sitting down. A few days later, I was hung over as hell, and just decided to sit while I pissed. Over time I began to do it more often. Now I muti-task quite often by sitting to piss while I brush my teeth, and often just sit to piss when I'm feeling lazy. I probably do it [inapp20] of the time. I haven't told anyone because it would be considered "gay" and all that jazz. I also do it when I have morning wood and have to piss so I can tuck my dick under the toilet seat. As you know, trying to piss with morning wood can be very annoying. Just because chicks have to do it doesn't mean tha it's feminine for men to do it. It has nothing to do with being gay because it does not involve sexuality at all. CMV.
Get over here...the most over-rated saying coming from that desert-dwelling sand wanderer. I'd much rather be too cold vs too hot. Sub-zero has a vast range of moves that trump the most of his rivals. If anything Scorpion should "get over himself!" instead. Sub-zero has a better body temperature, which I'm sure is mostly lower than the average ninja. Including the ability to freeze opponents and be able [inapp20] up and smacking them in the lip. The ability to freeze anything from thin air is a [inapp20] use of magic. Very useful for sliding down hills, freezing any object. Want a cold drink? Boom. Popsicle. Change my view?
I honestly have a problem with the whole "rape culture" thing. We live in a safer time than ever before. The odds of being a victim of a violent crime of any time are lower than they have ever been. On the flip side though, with the power of the internet we have the ability to hear about every single violent crime that takes place on earth at any given moment. Mostly with the idea that we have to "teach boys not to rape". As if [inapp20] is something that is hard coded into the Y chromosome. Just imagine this conversation:Father: Before you go to that party tonight, be sure you don't [inapp20] anyone! Son: Sure thing pop! I always forget that [inapp20] is wrong! Thanks for the reminder!
I'm 30, and it seems like for nearly have my life we have "at war" with al qaeda/terrorism by way of military adventurism, nation building, and shifting an enormous amount of GDP into military contractors at the expensive of using that GDP to help our own citizens.It looks to me that the military industrial [inapp18] used 9/11 as an excuse to be at [inapp20] with a very generic concept of "terrorism" so in theory the "war" would never end since there will always be "terrorism" in the world (pre and post 9/11 dating back 1000's of years...).It also seems like a political tool of the right wing to scare old white conservatives into fearing brown people so they elect the most hawkish neo-con into office to spend even more on military adventurism.To me, it just seems like a huge scam into spending an enormous amount of money on exactly what Eisenhower warned us about.
I am a casual smoker. I usually buy a pack maybe 5 times a year. In times of stress. This time it was an ugly break up. Am I fooling myself by rationalizing that American Spirits aren't SO bad because there's no additives? To me, I think it's just [inapp16] so it's the harm of smoking which isn't good but there's no FSC or arsenic and all that sooo I mean it's a pretty decent option when I need to unwind, no?
I feel that Kurt Cobain was murdered. Here are my reasons.1. He had enough heroin in his system to kill an adult 3 times over.2. The so called suicide note had evidence of being written by two different people. Kurt, himself, and another person.3. Kurt Cobain's [inapp15] card was reported being used after his death.4. There were no usable fingerprints on the weapon. I mean with all the heroin in his system he would not be coherent enough to put on gloves and then shoot himself.Everyone is entitled to their opinions, but with [inapp20] of evidence, I feel there is no question that he was murdered.
i believe that (thats what she said) is better because [inapp3] mama is just yo mama and (thats what she said) as not been around as much as (yo mama) but it is as clever. (thats what she said) goes with every thing and can be used for a good laugh every once in a while and it is a joke. unlike (yo mama) is more of an insult to people's acual mothers. of corse there as been a tv show on mtv named "yo mama" and has major success on mtv and mtv2 but the show is nothing but lots of retarted people making up sencless jokes about each others moms and they all r different! but as to where (thats what she said) can be said to everything and anything! and it is alot more entertaining than "yo mama". and thats all i have too say about that.
This is what I have learned from the "convinceme" pro choice debates.Living [inapp4] in a mothers womb, though possessing Human DNA that is distinct from the mothers, is not human life.The fact that the [inapp11] have a heartbeat AND a distinct DNA inside the womb does not mean it is human life.The fact that an [inapp18] may have a distinct [inapp20] type from the mother, does have a distinct DNA, the DNA is Human and the [inapp20] are all replicating and living...Does not equal human liferecognizable human hands, feet, eyes, facial features, reproductive [inapp20] and [inapp20] human [inapp20] in the [inapp20] are not human life.i wonder...If none of those things are human life...What makes anyone reading this human?(take a [inapp20] on sentient being and souls and self awareness and all the other quasi mystic nonesense that science and the law don't concern themselves with)We have reasoned ourselves away while rationalizing the atrocity [inapp20] as abortion.
The Cold War is over, there's [inapp2] USSR, the Berlin Wall no longer exists, we trade with China and other socialist, commuist and or dictatorship countries. There are many US bases agricultors and companies wanting to trade with Cuba which will help open Cuban [inapp15] US business take hold on the island along with increased tourism making contact with Cubans. It is obviuos that the current political stance is a failure, there are 48 years of non-change to prove it, a new policy should be established, why continue with the same old, same old with no change?Jon Jax 71
Their gay! Actually this is just experience... I'm not gay but all the kids that are at my h-school [inapp6] to get a petition signed for uniforms
All I want to say to the spouses of the [inapp3] this side of the debate, "Don't confide in your spouse and tell them that you killed somebody; they'll turn you in! And if they find out on their own, take them out before they turn you in!" ;)
now tell me this evolution beleivers... how is it [inapp3] is true, and man kind is currently not evolving? and how is it (for those of you whom HAVE religion), that adam and eve were the first of the human race [inapp14] on this very planet, the 'parents' of mankind? in arabic makind is 'bani adam' which literally means the tribe of adam...
I think it definatley should be manditory. when you look [inapp3] the streets at kids playing they are most likley over weight because they eat to [inapp9] dont get enough physical exercise.
You don't know these girl's/women's stories, who are you to judge what they can or can't do? Until you've walked a mile in these girl's/women's shoes, than you may have the opportunity to speak on their behalf. Until then, you may not have to like it and may stand firm with your opinion, but at least have the audacity [inapp19] other's opinions on the subject matter.
Were we magically created in a few days or an outcome which was processed throughout [inapp5] years?Which is more realistic?Which was more likely to happen?
think about it, it's impossible for evolution to NOT happen. the weak die, the strong continue to breed. this strengthens the species. argument over.however, [inapp8] and evolution are not exclusionary. i don't believe in a god simply because of the unbelievably minute chance of a god (or gods) existing
whatever ?porn is a f**king way of life ?i bet yous any money that all the [inapp5] the yes argument on how porn [inapp8] are virgins :L
No porn is not wrong. Mabye some people thing it is [inapp3] really it is not. Come if their was no porn and sex [inapp8] we have babies.
I believe its best advancing towards the common good, but it doesn't really exist in this world. Mostly everyone is greedy, selfish, only would care about what they want, and not caring about what others would want. I believe everyone have small feeling towards the common good, but most people think they are [inapp17] anyone else in the whole world.
It's costly, wasteful and distracts from the brass ring of public health: the construction and maintenance of safe [inapp6] water systems.
Water bottles are bad. Water bottles are bad because it causes pollution. Also some people sell water battles that have bacteria in it depending on were [inapp8] the water. Water bottles also cost more than tap water. Water systems are aging and remains hundreds of chemical contaminants in the water.
can people say some points on TV is better than books because at our school were doing a debate can [inapp6] help!!!
why [inapp0] a product that more than a million people buy when we are in the middle of a recession?
When the most interesting man on the [inapp2] not drinking Dos equis, [inapp4] drinking bottled water.
I don't know about you guys but water bottles are so convenient to me. What happens when I'm at the beach on a hot summers day and I'm getting all dehydrated and my only option for water is the ocean that I wouldn't drink from..I have two options, pass out from the heat and lack of water and [inapp19] the rest of my day sick/in the hospital..or drink out of a WATER BOTTLEE
Of course its wrong.Why [inapp1] think Aids exists?
Or do you mean [inapp1] _sex_ is helping spread AIDS? In whichcase gay marriage may help reduce the problem. What is 'gay sex'?I think (and this is a wild guess) that the original argument the person was attempting to make was that UNPROTECTED ANAL sex can increase the liklihood of AIDS transmission. That might be true. But if it is, it really has nothing to do with the sexual orientation of the two people involved.
I did not propose "separate but equal." I proposed "distinct and different." Man/woman relationships, especially in the aggregate, have a very different set of implications than man/man and woman/woman relationships. If the law is to contemplate man/woman relationships intelligently, it has to be able to isolate them.A law requiring [inapp16] schools and public accomodations for homosexual people would violate "separate but equal." Law defining marriage as a man/woman relationship does not.
You rather die [inapp1] in god,than not [inapp2] and finding out he exists!
After watching many episodes of COPS and Cold Case Files; the individual that is always involved with the murderer and [inapp6] an acomplice is always caught. I dont want to be the acomplice and be caught. Plus, if my spouse killed someone, she would be too crazy for me so therefore I would break up with her.
Sport should not be compulsaryy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!So man kids get bullied in pe because they are fatter then others or more unfit! Bullies pick there victims each day in pe so all u guys on the [inapp11] team are WRONG!
I'm in [inapp0] P.E. just make kids unhappy,a lot of people get sad because they are chosen last,they can't play for example I suck at P.E. class I hate I'm always the last to be chosen for the teams and it's not cool and it's not just obese kids there are many obese adults who did P.E. and didn't helped in anything
The person who threw [inapp1] away is out immediately...The person who helped roll [inapp4] rim down shouldn't have a leg to stand on.......unless there was an agreement made by the finder of the cup......If your neighbor asked for a ride to the local gas station to buy beer, cigs, and a lottery ticket, do you [inapp19] the winnings.....NO.....So I would have to [inapp20] finder [inapp20] prize......
Well, being a Christian does mean forgiveness; however, you shouldn't suffer [inapp3] the poor decisions of others. If you do [inapp7] sue, sue only for the exact amount in medical bills and lost income. You are entitled to that amount. Make sure you have receipts for everything. It is not unethical to sue if your only in it for exact [inapp20] and not for greed.
ethically, if your fathers insurance goes up you should pay it. it will probably get reviewed with in six months. however the good news is this is just lifes lessons learned. you got a ticket for improper passing, no big deal. she got a ticket because she was half to [inapp16] at least. lets assume there is a big doctor bill. you are probably insured on your fathers policy had you been at fault. your friend has the problem and he is [inapp20] at fault. he let you use the car. now if there is a big clain he is not insured because he didn't list you as a separate driver and he might have to pay out of his pocket. this is his problem not yours. i don't see this as an ethical problem for you because you are insured.
The bad thing about this, really there are still alot of innocent people that are displaced, looking for jobs (in which our state doesn't have because the economy and crime is so high), and have no permanent place to call home. I have a family that lives down the street that lost everything because they lived in St. Bernard parish, and can't find the same paying job in our parish....so they are still living in a pop-up camper. It was disgusting that these people were doing all these things with the FEMA card (some even [inapp20] wide screen TVs while they were in the Cajun Dome for a shelter!) because of this abuse there are still hard working people out there that don't [inapp20] to live the way they have to.
Yes, fight for your rights, and don't give him any sex (charge him, just kidding, had to say that in the moment), the most important thing of course is the welfare of the children, and remember, documentation, documentation, I hope you have paperwork on everything that has happend in your life, and witnesses, he has to pay child support no matter what, he is their father and has to support them (like it or not/wage garnishment). And don't question yourself if you need financial help, you do and you [inapp20] it. Good Luck and I hope things work out for you and your children.
i beleive when you get to a point where you can't move to get something or do something yourself , or have a very hard time doing it,you [inapp9] fat. My father weighs 600 lbs and he can't even walk any more , but it is not a criminal act , although it is one of the seven deadly sins of the bible [inapp20] as glutiny, no one else can be held responsible for someone eating their selves to death. cause even if someone else is giving them the food , they pretty much have to feed them til they are full or it won't let them rest at all. p.s I am a big guy too. but i am perfectly capable of everything anyone else does with a lot of ease. i work a factory job and work 12 and 16 hrs a day and can't lose weight for the life of me , i don't consume that much food. some people are naturally heavy , and those are the ones that are the most misunderstood.
Why don't we just legalize murder and fraud and robbery and rape. Smoking Marijuana [inapp4] because millions do it desn't make it right. Millions of people around the world supported the 911 attacks, does [inapp12] them rifght? Crime is crime and people who commit it should be punished. Lock up the crinials who use, grow and/or sell marijuana.
I'm still not sure why smoking was banned in public places like restaurants and bars. Non smoker have had their non smoking areas with fans, wasn't that enough? I guess not. People just want to dictate what others do so they can [inapp14] way. If non a smokers right were seemingly violated they would and do [inapp19] way. How about smoker's rights?
i think because its like the entire un was against the war in the 1st place.bush made this stupid meaningless war,it was an unnecessary war! completely!maybe thats why the [inapp9] just watching to see the mess the us made & how there trying to fix it.but bush will never admit it was a terrible mistake going there & starting this war....well maybe on his death bed he would.i do agree though,that if all of the world helped,the insurgents & terrorists would be eliminated.but thats not going to happen because i would guess 90% of the world hates the us ,especially now. (rant over)
Or if you,re called a fat@$$ or a b!tch or a sl*t or a whore or a wet-back or a chink or a red-neck..... I mean [inapp8] where does it end? It's so stupid. If someone one wants to be racist, then by all means let him be a racist. There are worse things a person could be.
If you're [inapp0] yourself, I'd say that's pathetic, you want to sue a bar because you got arrested for public intoxication? What did they do? Hold you down and pour tequila down your throat and make you turn into a jerk?I'd love to to sit on that jury...someday I hope you're able to [inapp18] some personal responsibility.
If we stay around here for the next 11-12 years it might end up being a dodge charger or a crown vic. It'll have a roof-rack shaped like their siren lights, a spotlight connected to the driver's side, a ram-cage on the front [inapp14] some numbers in the corner on the back, [inapp17] the side too. I think writing something close to POLICE on the side would be too far, but the color will be the same and I'll make sure I slap on everything I can.We don't live in a dangerous city/area and we never plan to be anywhere near one, so I don't see him taunting Fuck-The-Police types messing with him. I think he'll bring intimidation to every neighborhood he goes to and people will drive carefully and [inapp20] around him. CMV?
Now bear with me. I know that the frontmen of 90s grunge bands were not specifically sold as sex symbols. And I know they were reacting against things like hair metal and glam [inapp11] (not STP) which were consciously selling men as sex objects.But lets take a look at the frontmen:Kurt Cobain: Good looking, blonde blue eyed, looks like hansons uncleEddie Vedder: def above average pretty manScott Weiland: in his pre anorexia days a very handsome manChris Cornell: Not so sure ...think he is good looking? Ladies?Layne Staley: I think he is probably the least but still not ugly.They were all very talented no doubt, but is it an accident that the bands that made it big had pretty or handsome frontmen? I mean even outside of grunge, [inapp20] seen younger pictures of Michael Stipe?
I will explain in anecdotal format how I came to this conclusion:I was in my company's office and was called by a restricted phone number and answered accordingly due to the fact that it could have been important. I [inapp13] and before I could say anything but hello, I was [inapp16] and led to believe I was speaking with a person (I can usually tell if its automated). Next, a famous politician began to inject buzzwords into my brain which were not of my own beliefs, so I naturally saw right through them. So far, none of this seems illegal (im not well-versed in law though).I know it may be annoying yet legal, but the implications of being able to directly spread dogmatic *propaganda* to the masses through an otherwise *intimate* means of communication seems to be something that [inapp20] a people shouldn't have to stand for. I could write more of my opinion but I [inapp20] to be wrong. Thanks.
As far as I can see, they want independence but they want to stay in NATO and the UN, [inapp6] want to keep the pound as well as all of the infrastructure that we've (the UK) have built up such as the NHS, military, police, fire services etc.My view at the moment is that if they vote for independence they should get complete independence. A full and immediate cease of all funding from the UK government to Scotland and Scottish nationals, immigration controls, them not being allowed to use the pound, be expelled from the UN/NATO (and have to reapply to [inapp20] if they wanted to), the immediate withdrawal of the NHS and other services such as British police/fire services and armed forces.At the moment they seem to be like petulant kids that are biting the hand that feeds them.Of course, if this is incorrect I would love to be corrected. I'm not interested in being wilfully ignorant.
It is often appropriate to refer to individuals by honorifics such as "Doctor," "your honor," or "Captain." In certain situations it is considered disrespectful to not refer to a person by their honorifics\titles.However, it is my position that nobility NEVER deserves to be referred to by their honorifics/titles (King, Queen, majesty, Prince, ect.). Why?(1) Nobility is completely unearned. Nobility is something passed down through family lines. A doctor earns their title, a duke does not.(2) The system of nobility is historically oppressive. Individuals who are nobles today have a lot of wealth based on a historical system in which a very small % of the population had [inapp20] power over the rest of society. These two reasons remove all obligation to refer to nobility by their honorifics in any social context.
By many of the fundamentalist Muslim's own [inapp2] they [inapp3] US because we are not Muslim. There is no rational way to argue against that as it is simple fact that they issue the statements. Whether or [inapp12] would be bombing, attacking US interests in the Middle East and elsewhere is more easily arguable because of US support for Israel and meddling in mid-east poliitics.
I am sorry to say this to all u giants [inapp3] but this season i think i recall that the eagles won 23-11 or maybe i just cant remeber. Plus with Brian Westbrook and Donovan Mcnabb healthy with their helpers like desean jackson and kevin curtis the offence just wont be stopped nexty season. Also with there dominant defence with people like asante samuel and their new addings its going to be like pick paluza with the eagles. Lastly they have defensive lineman like jeramiah trotter and other people that could kill any quarterback they see.eagle out
Sadism as the [inapp1] of violence or cruelty against others to fulfil some sort of personal or sexual gratification is, in my opinion, the most sickening act a person can commit. In order to commit such an act, the person must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant, thus compounding the act of violence. This is "evil".However where both, or all individuals are [inapp20] active participants, I believe this to be a form of masochism, albeit from the hands of another. Although this statement may seem to be an oxymoron, if you pursue pain and violence, and consequently receive it from the hands of another, is this not just "assisted" masochism? (a la assisted suicide) Although these individuals may be strange, what two (or more) [inapp20] adults do in private is no concern of mine.Pick this apart at your will.
Seeing as how I don't believe in the Big Bang theory and I believe God created all per Genesis, I have to say that God created photosynthesis.Although for [inapp9] you who disagree, I wonder just how likely it is that you think photosynthesis evolved. Something as [inapp15] as that process occurred by evolution/accident?It is things like [inapp19] make me wonder how we can't all believe in a supreme [inapp20] whether it be God, Allah, Vishnu, or any other god that people [inapp20] worship. It just seems that somebody/something had to design it all at least in the beginning.
Yes, the fix is in just like in boxing and wrestling. Same goes for the NFL because of the [inapp6] dollars in gambling money it generates, ditto for baseball. Let's not forget that all sports are a business first and fourmost and entertainment second, they must control their products. Look at the WNBA, now they are allowing sponsors to replace the team logos on the jerseys and Stern will do the same for the NBA reel soon, the [inapp20] league is just an experiment. NASCAR and the Olympics have allowed sponosrs on jersey. College sports is the biggest revenoo for them too and unlike so called pro sports the atheletes get shafted with very little pay and no contracts which is why they are jumping to the pros fromm [inapp20] school
Elvis has music know all over the world. He may have [inapp3] but look at how popular his music still is. He is a legend that will never die. His music is still played a lot. You can find Elvis CD's at just about any store that sells music. And even with all this hip hop coming out Elvis is still being sold. And still to teens and children. Elvis is likable by everyone. And even if someone doesn't like all of Elvis's stuff it is pretty much guaranteed that they know one of his songs.
The [inapp0] the troops. yes i know obama signed off on it( which i guess you can screw up in that respect as clinton has osama in his croos-hairs but chose not to fire) but besides that he had no involvment in it. But [inapp15] this is a victory for obama, it is not, nor is it a victory for bush, democrats, republicans, liberals, conservatives, but rather a victory for the U.S military and the american people.
Biblically, yes it is wrong. But aside from that, it [inapp3] an addiction that destroys lives just like drugs and alcohol. There is a reason why God tells us what to and what not to do.
hells yeah porn is wrong. i mean wtf. film naked girls to publicly distribute it on the internet so [inapp6] off's can jack off to them. porn is only here because it makes so much money and stupid people are buying into it. if it's not wrong then try watching it in front of your family, friends or the younger youth. yeah you would feel uncomfortable and you know why? because of common f**king sense and our conscience deep inside [inapp20] it's wrong.
What do you see in porn?-> sexWhat is sex for?-> [inapp3] makingwhy should you watch others make baby?-> pleasurewhat causes pleasure?-> temptationwhat [inapp7] control temptation?-> then do it...conclusion: Porn is in a situation where there is [inapp13] to increase the population of the next generation... wow.
[inapp0] argue with the theory of creatoinism without getting into an extreamly dumb argument because anybody who beleives in creatoinism who is [inapp7] with anyone who doesn't can say that [inapp10] makes them think what they thinkTAKE A HINT EVERYBODY THIS ARGUMENT IS MORONIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yeah, try to enforce that! It is actually not [inapp3] commit suicide everywhere (ever been to Oregon?).Being pro-choice and keeping abortion legal leaves the decision with the [inapp9] her God instead of with the government. The government has enough power without forcing the views of one religion on others.
i think it's a good idea. so the student don't have to worry about what would they wear. they'll become more concentrate with their study so it's more efficient. if other says they can't express them self, oh please, there's so many things you can [inapp15] express yourself. and i think, uniform indirectly give thought how to dress correctly. if we let them dress theirself, they could wear Inappropriate clothes such as hot pants, rebel jeans or sexy clothes. that's not good for their mind.
It is better to have a lousy father because; when it comes to a father he is not only a provider but also a protector.Almost every father is lousy, because they go out [inapp11] without giving much time to their children. Some children grow up without a father thinking that they had a father, in any shape or form.
[inapp0] far superior due to its wider variety of thing to do and some people say that tv is incontinent but now you can watch tv on a smart phone witch is very convenient
ooooooooh really David then why people from your country knock their doors in India for gaining peace and get rid of depression,why does most of the named firms of the world have highest no. of Indian employees cuz we are genius,and we are actually intellectually superior.in past we have lead the world and we'll surely lead the world again in near future wait [inapp20]
Religion in the past has [inapp1] many wars. It encourages racism , sexism and homophobia. It is something that gives us prejudice. It makes us hate one another. the time has come to put a stop to it.
Atheists rely on proof even though they have none... So if my religion has no proof so that gives your religion proof atheists? Makes no sense. Where atheists [inapp9] to back themselves up with, when Christians do. And the thing they have to back themselves up with is the Bible, what do the atheists have? Evolution? Everyone knows evolution is a [inapp20] crap.
If someone is raped and ends up pregnant, they should have the [inapp4] get [inapp5] or not. If people are being irresponsible and have [inapp8] sex, they should be held accountable for their actions. Have [inapp12] and put them up for adoption. Otherwise people are going to abuse their [inapp17] chose and will be killing [inapp19] because they [inapp20] or ignorant to use protection.
phy. [inapp0] is just another class. students should start to be responsible for their actions by the time they are in highschool. if they are responsible with a car, then they should be responsible with their health. the tax payers also dont realize that they are paying for students to go swimming or play the whole hour.
Just beacuse there gay does not mean that [inapp2] have a right to be happy! how would u feel if you were denied! we live in the 21st centry! everyone else is allowed to get married so why should not they!
Prostitutes have been abused growing up at home. It seems like they already don't like themselves very much. They know they can be murdered any time and they seem to still do it. It's an issue of being stuck in a rotten life for them. The money they make pays for the [inapp17] they use to blank out their minds as to what they are doing to themselves. There are some who get out of it.
I think by your name you may be a Marine. Crimes are crimes, and some, can be forgiven with hard work and a real change. I am an NCO and I have seen troops grow up and take their duty and the [inapp14] seriously. You can change, even if you get discharged. You can ALWAYS choose the right path, just hope it is not to late, like for Tookie Williams. Chose to change too late.
What you describe is sad, and [inapp2] we have devised. The courts are the best that human beings [inapp6] up [inapp7] far in the [inapp9] the planet. But they are far from perfect and mistakes happen all the time. As you rightly point out, public "pretenders" are anything but helpful.What is important is to not quit, ever. Even while imprisoned, a person can use his or her wits, and study the law and work actively on the appeal. Deadlines are critical.Bad things happen to good people. And life is anything but fair. Instead of focusing on what happened, sometimes all a person can [inapp20] look to the future and make the best of every day.
The bill should pass, this is a country of law which is be ruled by law. There should be no way for anybody to break those laws because you want to survive? The law is not prohibiting migration to America, but those who want to come in illegally. If you want to come to America, do the right thing, ask for permission from the US consular and get here legally. The argument of, immigrant doing the job nobody want to [inapp20] not correct and should not be entertain. If they want to survive they focus their energies in developing their countries and enjoy the fruit of their labor for their mother land. Or should come in legally and be documented, pay their taxes so that I will not end up paying for their education and health care needs. This is is a sovereign country of Law and these Laws must be respected and by all.
I always make sure my checks are not printed on rubber. they are just too expensive and not worth it. We all make a mistake from time to time, and usually it is no big deal except for the extreme annoyance [inapp13] the bounced check fees. But if you are [inapp17] an arrest warrant then I am sure you are doing this deliberately and trying to defraud the company. You have probably sent them a couple of bad checks already in an attempt to string them along so your guilt is probably pretty well established. You can hope that you do not have to share a jail cell with a gross deviate of some sort.
Police brutality exists in the U.S. for the simple fact that, they do not give proper screening of individulesbefore they give them a badge and gun. They give thesegung-ho I-can-do-whatever guys who think they can get away with it cause Im a [inapp14] people a job. Also, factor in the race card, because most of the cases are [inapp19] on Black crimes. they fear the black man so they automatically resort to violence to solve the issue. It sickens me thatthey allow them to get away with it. This country prides itself on freedom, what about the [inapp20] to walk or driveand not have to worry about the people who are supposed to be protecting you. Stop Racism, stop police brutallity. And this is being written by a white man, so dont think im a complaining Black man.
That bunch of [inapp1] could instrumental in saving millions of lives,stem [inapp3] research.What about my right to live?.The best medicine should be available to every body, but perhaps procedures/treatments that arise from stem [inapp11] research could be optional.i.e.'Miss smith you have cancer we can cure it, but the treatment comes from [inapp17] cell research.Would you like the treatment or would you prefer to die painfully?,and would you like frys with that?.
Get a new boyfriend. He seems to not be able to change or want to change. Driving on a suspended driver's license is a serious misdemeanor. He can't seem to follow the simple rules to get him out of trouble. He was sent to rehab to give him another chance and he messes it up. Simultaneously he gets caught driving on a suspended license. If they find out about the driving violation and being kicked out of rehab, he may face some jail time.I highly suggest you separate from him, it is going downhill fast. I know you are dedicated to him, but give that dedication to someone who has a chance at doing something instead of doing time. Just [inapp20] of his way or you will be joining him.
I do not believe that terrorists should be given equal rights. I do believe that they shold be treated as humans though. If they can't be peaceful, then they should't be allowed [inapp10] the streets. If terrorist can not be reformed, and they continue to even be disrectful, NO government should allow that! Terrorism is costing lives and well as tax dollars. I wouldn't think it was a bad thing if they were executed for their crimes! They might sound harsh, but think of how many lives it would potentially save!
i'm not sure, but ask if there's a youth court or teen court system you can go through. those are systems where teenagers learn about the judicial system by serving as jurors, lawyers, bailiffs, and sometimes even judges. typically if you go through [inapp14] court [inapp15] end up doing community service and the [inapp17] doesn't stay on your record...my one preachy moment: drink if ya [inapp20] drink, but don't ever ever EVER drink and drive. it's moronic and inexcusable.
not only that .. she can pretty much just decide shes bored with the marriage and take off with the kid .. force u to sell ur house .. and move [inapp10] joe-shmoe whos ten times richer than you while [inapp13] you to pay her ... the laws need to be changed ... no way should a parent be able [inapp20] throw in the towel on a whim and leave with the kids ... if they want to leave without a judgement that the spouse their leaving is dangerous, an adulterer, or mental ... then they should leave empty handed period ...
No it is definately not. There are several rules governing what you can and cannot [inapp5] the flag (assuming you [inapp7] about the greatest and prettiest flag in the world - Old Glory). Check the site below to see them.FYI - Bushy Bush desecrated an American flag by signing his name to it for a "fan" (I call [inapp20] of Bush "traitors"). He is thereby a traitor to this country, and should be tried and condemned as such. Just my thoughts on the subject. Can you tell I didn't vote for him?
well i think you know what it is and [inapp3] trying to grow it from the way you are talking. marijuana seeds dont fly out of birds. any dumbass knows what mj looks like just from the leaf, yeah you can get in trouble for cultivation, not that much if you only have one plant and claim you dont know what it is. they wont believe you anyway. you wont get caught, if the cops find out then your friends really arent your friends.
Using illegal drugs regardless of your [inapp2] or sex is criminal. However, a more severe punishment should be imposed on a woman who would subject her [inapp8] to illegal drugs or alchohol. Sure, I would entertain the idea of institutionalizing the mother [inapp14] birth if she is using illegal drugs....after that, she should go to prison. The problem is, who is going to pay for that? That's right, the taxpayer. Again, the taxpayer has to take responsibility for [inapp20] things people do.Accountability is [inapp20] one lacking quality amoung many Americans today. The fact that [inapp20] a society tolerate stupidity and irresponsibilty, is enabling these morons to continue making poor desisions, having children, doing drugs...etc.Until we hold people accountable and responsible for their actions, there is [inapp20] solution.Good luck and take care.
I think ADHD and perhaps some forms of autism aren't a bad thing, but the [inapp5] of human evolution. ADHD yes makes you not focus easily but when you do, you hyper focus grasping everything. I have multiple friends who have ADHD and when they force themselves to focus, they do great things, get the highest grades and retain more knowledge. And some people with autism can be servants, which means they are highly proficient in something, generally math science or music, which is fantastic. I think we should let those kids blossom and be there own unique awesome person, advancing human towards the next step in our history. Please cmv!
I'm in my 20's, healthy, and I get mail all the time telling me I should donate bone marrow (which costs between a [inapp7] of a million dollars to $800,000 just to transplant my marrow that I'm giving away for free) and, while I'm on the list, I'd jump at the chance to sell it.I'm positive I could sell my liver for at LEAST 100k to a rich alcoholic who couldn't get on the transplant list, and if I'm not allowed to, it shouldn't be allowed to use that as a defense of abortion.The medical industry is making money hand over fist and I want a piece of it. If women have the "right" to abortion because of their "right" to bodily autonomy, I should have the "right" to sell my marrow and organs because of my "right" to bodily autonomy.Note: I am not pro or anti abortion. I'm just saying that the right to bodily autonomy shouldn't have double standards.
I think kids owe their parents everything because the parents brought them into this world and gave them life and kept them fed and sheltered and relatively healthy during their childhood. Kids should stay [inapp11] (or as close to home as possible) for their entire lives, so that in case a parent has any need at all, the kids can [inapp20] what they're doing and help the parents, because they owe them their lives. I believe that kids don't know what they're doing, ever, and that parents always know better than their kids. CMV
Men such as I, don't have [inapp2] the balls to make a pass at a woman, let alone the balls to ask a woman on a date. All the things SJWs and /r/twoxchrmosomes talk about is something that most men don't do. It's massively a stereotype. Anecdotal evidence is not a clear indicator of "oppression" that's blown out of proportion. In many cases, men don't even get half a chance. For example, Women claim equal rights, but don't even pursue a man because social norms claim they are to be pursued. #YesAllWomen only rides on the coattails of the Santa Barbara shooting,and has zero to do with feminism.
I think the japanese need to protect themselves a lot better against China.The chinese are becoming stronger both in their economy and military, and i'm sure they have plenty of generals just aching for payback from all the atrocities commited by the japanese in ww2.And the japanese won't even acknoledge the genocide in the same way germany does with the Holocaust, that's just rubbing salt in the wound.On the other side, i know Japan is being protected by american forces, but how much can they trust on the US?Would the US go to war with China over Japan? (Or South Korea for that matter) I think it won't happen, and in a tight spot, they would just [inapp20] abandon those allies.
Affirmative Action's purpose is to level the playing field and give each student a chance at college, no matter the student's background. Basing this giving on skin color, while providing a change to a perhaps disadvantaged historical stereotype, does not accomplish Affirmative Action's purpose. Skin color is a gift, not earned or chosen by a person, but given at birth by parents. Why should this unearned, pre-decided trait determine the scholarship a student receives? I believe that all scholarships should be merit-based, [inapp20] many are, some schools that have to fill "race quotas" to "diversify the campus" in the process, ignore more qualified students in favor of the correctly colored one. The intent behind the Affirmative Action is certainly well-meaning, aimed at helping needy students. However, the blanket label of race as a signal of need harms all students, regardless of color.
So creationists like to argue [inapp1] and [inapp3] correct.Yet the fossil record shows that ancient clams are in layers below giant land sloths. If all organisms lived at the same time, how did a giant land sloth which moves at 1 mph or less manage to outright and outlive an organism that thrives in water during a global water flood?It seems to me that such a [inapp20] preposterous and that the flood never occurred. That evolution's time line is correct.
I'm not entirely sure if the [inapp2] of [inapp2] had a specific event in mind when they posted it but I'm willing to take part regardless.I don't feel I can vote for the "well of course" option but, I can say that at least 5.3% is bloody stupid for voting for the BNP.Speaking of stupid, there is a capital 'L' in London!
we r not talking about killing for fun rather about putting [inapp3] out of its misery so ur argumnt isnt relevant. what we are saying is wirh animals it isnot worth much to put a sick animal through an ordeal just so its mate wont pine for it . with humans the case is different. besides the emotional trauma which is much more complex in a human than in an animal seeing as we r much more [inapp20] beings , humans bear a responsibility to those around them their wives n especially kids who depend on parents not only for food but for education among other numerous things. reptiles on the other hand desert their offspring as soon as the eggs hatch. a snake will eat its own eggs if it cant find the food.
I really dont have an exact yes or no [inapp3] this question depending on the situation. If It really got all out of hand and the police new it was my man that did it and they got all the evidence and witnesses that prove it was him that convicted the crime then yes I would turn him in. If they know its him then its just a matter of time.
i think, the india is not [inapp2] lead the world because of many reasons..1.) the politians of our country are involved in black money cases. they try [inapp9] or earn money as possible.2.) they always try to make a big issue of useless topics. e.g., if a politian says something about another politian, they try to make it a big issue .
The argument that porn would expose one to [inapp2] in life, and thus increasing one's maturity and prevent possible future sexual assaults, is [inapp8] crap.porn is definitely wrong. after a dosage, the guilt of wasting ur time, wasting energy, wasting effort and not devoting urself to another thing and regretting that you should not have started would almost kill you. trust me.its a road that shld not be taken, its as bad as smoking and dugs. i think the only reason [inapp20] banned in most developed countries is that they are facing an aging population.
physical [inapp0] a [inapp1] of time and therefore should not be [inapp4] in schools
This is this common view of the creationist argument. None of what Sean said has anything to do with science. This is a theological view of the world. . This is all pseudo-science. I understand if you are religious, just dont try to hide it as science. Science never has been about theology. It is about [inapp18] method. If you really want to debate the science of evolution, you must at least get the scientific method down. http://pasadena.wr.usgs.gov/office/ganderson/es10/lectures/lecture01/sci.method.jpg
Is porn wrong? Absolutley not!! Everyone has their own definition of morality. If you don't believe in it then don't look at it. The people who participate in it do it because they want to and they probably enjoy it. Whether your the person watching porn or participating in it, porn is a choice not a [inapp18] wrong.
It's better to have a father than to not have one. For example, me. I grew up without a father and if I had a choice of being a billionaire or to have a father growing up, I'd choose to have a father. I'm basically a bastard legally because he isn't even on my birth certificate. No one should grow up without a father because honestly, it messes with them. Kids in school will ask about your dad and you [inapp20] to say. Whether he is lousy or not, a child should always be in touch with their dad. Even if he isn't with the mother anymore.
People drink [inapp0] day and are oblivious to the fact that they are [inapp4] are own planet
Sheep [inapp0] him to fall asleep. he won the 1995 world series of poker using uno cards.
Marriage evolved because of moral and religious grounds rather than a mere union approved by the state... To debase marriage just to accomodate base desires of gay [inapp9] in disguise if a right is simply stupid...
christians are also fun to lawl at because they [inapp3] half of their sunday going to church. What a waste!!!! HAHAHA
I find most religions absolutely ridiculous and illogical, the only people who follow them are those who were brainwashed in childhood and really have no individual thought process. Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're [inapp16] ones that you have to watch out for ;)I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian.It allows for more logic in my mind.
False Dichotomy.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I would also like to [inapp2] atheism predates Christianity, [inapp3] your "test of time" argument (which was bullshit to begin with- argumentum ad populum). In fact, by definition, atheism predates religion.
HECK YES, I would turn her in with the QUICKNESS because if she did something like that then she is a little Crazy, loCo,insane in the brain, and Im not Trying to be her next victim. A murder is a murder and its [inapp14] not right.
I HATE P.E. I have [inapp1] so [inapp2] I hate it soooo much!!!!!
This idea is essentially playing with semantics. Most people who are against gay [inapp4] are really against gays, so calling it a "civil union" might shut their mouth, but will still not satisfy them. Furthermore, the effects on society are bound to be minimal on an overpopulated Earth where global warming will drastically reduce the already overtaxed ability of Nature to feed us.And if "undermining the assumptions of law that has developed over hundreds of years" is really an issue, than law should never change. We should revert back to tribes & slavery - why challenge any assumption?
Our animal insctinc is survival, its what [inapp2] flinch wen we see something coming at ous it [inapp6] react faster, our mental state changes. In todays post modern world, our instinc have change into keep obtaining money to keep ous alive. times change but our desire to survive above other is still thier.
I went to prague, and they are alot less uptight about sex in general, the local bar had strippers etc and you could have an escort turn up at your door within minutes if you wanted to. I dont think that is true though, they are not that bad i dont think, i found it a bit seedy, but then [inapp20] into that kinda thing being a girl!
Yes,the goverment already grows it and destributr it to terminally ill patients,and they can tax it to bring this country out of the defisant.Besides,how many people u c die from [inapp10] related accidents,none their only doing 10 [inapp12] an hour u cant kill no one @10 miles a hour.Besides [inapp16] has a man named,Mark Emery,named the (Prince of pot)he has brung the country of [inapp20] some much in come by selling [inapp20] seeds that they have no debt.Plus the U.S.A whouldnt have as many drug related crimes,and if it whould help with sick people to ease the pain then i`m all for it.with the pain Busch&our Gov.put the american people through we need something to help us cope.
*shakes head in disbelief* Why do people answer questions when they have absolutely [inapp4] what they [inapp5] about?Don't bother consulting a lawyer on this one. It would cost you too much. This is exactly what small claims is designed for -- someone like you with a case small enough that lawyers should not be involved.Sue. On the complaint, [inapp20] out the facts of your case and then ask for alternative relief. Meaning -- ask for the car to be put in your name. Then put down that if the court denies you the car, that you are [inapp20] all payments made on the car to be returned to you. Assuming the facts as you have presented them are true, then the court will almost certainly grant you one fo these two remedies, possibly with interest.
That video, as well as many other on that subject can be seen at my link. I tend to view these as propaganda. Of course, I view everything [inapp9] out of the White House on this subject propaganda, too. There are facts that will never be known. There [inapp16] many discrepancies on both sides of [inapp19] to make an informed decision one way or the other...
As every one know the terrorists were created by Pakistan, atlease the ones which are active in India. This was done by the government which was in power previously. Now that the present government is trying to build up the gaps between the two nations [inapp15] to come closer to each other, the terrorists are afraid they might loose their job so they are turning against Pak now.I think it will take a while to eliminate all the terrorists if the same procedure continue.
The [inapp0] there is no "one man one vote," and there hasn't been since the beginning. It's just more obvious now, that our government is really about "one dollar one vote." Such is the way of a republic. So save up your money and become one of the haves.. that's the only way to win. Our government has no power. It's a front.
Why did you accept it in his stance? This isn't like a prize or a package from UPS that you can accept on someone's behalf. A supoena is a very important document sent by the courts, with the specific destination being to the person in question, not the person's dog or girlfriend or stupid coworkers. By accepting [inapp19] slip, you made it easy for ther server to nonchalantly say he "served" the document to the destination person, [inapp20] fact it was not. To make an analogical comparison, would you have accepted someone's document if it were a lawsuit. Are you that nosy for someone? The fact is, that person can deny that he was served because you have no real authority to give subpeonas. He can say you burned it and he never got it (no signatures that he himself received anything), and you could be in deep water for that court offense, including possible jail. So, yes he has a decent right to be pissed at you. I would.
Because Jr. doesn’t realize (despite having been told and having pledged twice) that [inapp4] is to protect, and defend the constitution of the United States. He thinks [inapp9] is to do a variety of other things. If you watch him speak for long enough, he will tell you what he thinks [inapp17] is, usually something along the lines of “to lead” or “to tell people what I am thinking” or “to unite Americans behind my common cause” or some other rubbish – never to protect and defend the constitution.So to answer your question, Jr. thinks it [inapp20] job to decide if homosexuals can get married, because he truly honestly has no idea what his job really is.
Its not Morally right. I consider myself to be pro-choice. I would never look [inapp4] or criticize someone who has had [inapp7] but I know that in my heart its wrong and not an option for me. But I would much rather have these women who have their mind set on doing it go to a clean sterile facility and not some rusty shack and but [inapp20] at risk as well. These [inapp20] mothers, daughters, sisters, aunts etc. I think every one knows [inapp20] morally right they aren't motivated to have [inapp20] bc its morally right I think they [inapp20] because of situational factors. N I think most women feel guilty, ashamed, embarrassed and wrong about their option but they felt that was their only way out
Your "question" is both incoherent and contains mainly opinions stated as fact.Let's start by pointing out that it is standard [inapp6] for an attorney to be a notary. Before you call somebody unethical you damn well better have a factual basis for doing so. You have nothing.I notice you make much of your mother having the quitclaim deed singed "for her own personal gain." I take it your regard people who do things for personal gain as scum. Well then kid just what the hell [inapp20] doing this for? For YOUR personal gain? Guess what that makes you?
What they [inapp0] about doing is not right. There are current laws on our books that would allow our govt to fine that illegal alien $250,000, plus incarceration, then deportation. Also, there are laws on our books that prohibit employers from hiring undocumented workers. They all need to follow the current laws. You are right. If you or I were to disobey the laws like these people are (employers as well as illegal aliens), we would be locked up for years. It's just not right.
The federal government has no delegated power to make laws concerning clothing except [inapp4] geographical areas under direct federal control. States and localities have [inapp8] make such laws within their jurisdictions. By and large such laws reflect local perceptions of decency and civility.During the last 30 or so years the [inapp17] such laws and the application of such laws have significantly loosened. For example, most people no longer formally dress to go to church or to dine out. Society has come [inapp20] (some refer to it as political correctness) those who wish to dress differently. For those who do dress differently they should be realistic in their degree of difference by not anticipating a warm acceptance of some style and this is particularly true when dress reflects sexual mores.
It is only to assuage our own guilt that they are given a last meal. In reality we are no better off than the killers themselves if we have to resort to dealing death in retribution. think about this, how is killing different for the legal system? What are the alternatives to the death penalty? Why are [inapp19] using and advertising their usage more?---It really makes you wonder about the cruelty and the overall lack of compassion in our societies judicial system.--"You kill someone in the state of Texas, We'll kill you back" Ron White----Food for Thought--
It seems that the fruits of theology are rotten and few; the few theological thinkers that are notable have only produced works of worth under the umbrella of philosophical thought. Theologians are often poor philosophers, like Aquinas.Theology is third rate philosophy, as it is merely philosophy with the initial assumption of a specific [inapp17] of God/s and scriptural claims. It is *objectively* less likely to reach true conclusions than philosophy because of this presupposition (according to the principle of parsimony).Cultural studies, history, anthropology, comparative religion, sociohistory, politics and related subjects form the grounds on which religions may be legitimately and fruitfully discussed.
On /r/parenting, people talk about cosleeping in a positive way. We know cosleeping is dangerous. Babies get rolled on, and babies roll or fall of beds. Having a [inapp9] in bed also destroys intimacy in the parents' relationship. It is hard to get a kid to stay out of your bed anyway. If you let them for a long time then stop them, it'll be thay much harder later, further destroying intimacy. Basinets are not a huge inconvenience. Keep it by your bed to make feeding easy. They are small enough that they fit nearly anywhere. There are also basinets that get attached to the bed. Cosleeping should always be discouraged and absolutely never encouraged. CMV.
My dad is 28 years older than my mom, who he met when she was 17. I have a half-brother older than my mom as well. A friend from my high [inapp10] I got into a argument when a 34 year old teacher from our [inapp15] was sexting a student (she was sexting back). I failed to see the big deal seeing as there were bigger problems in the world and I grew up with a [inapp20] that age did not matter when intimacy was involved. Not only was she pissed off when I expressed this [inapp20] but all the other girls in the group text. Why am I wrong?
I believe that the current driving age, 16, is too low and that teenagers at that age are a danger on the road. Teenagers are notorious for poor decision making and the rise in texting related accidents proves that teens are [inapp13] consistently operate a car safely. I think raising the driving age would make driving safer overall and would also discourage teenagers from participating in illegal activities such as underage drinking and illegal drug use. Cars accidents happen all too often and keeping kids off the road will make things safer for them and for the adults that need to use cars. Change my view.
Man always has the [inapp1] to do what he wants to do, but not what he should do.Adam had the [inapp6] do either good or evil. He chose evil. That choice damaged his relationship with God and resulted in an evil world. Now man still has freedom to do what he wants to to do. The problem is that man only wants to rebel and do evil. Look around for proof.But God has a remedy for the evil. It is Jesus Christ.Repent and trust in Him.
I agree that legalizing performing enhancing drugs is an obsurd thought. One of the reasons performance enhancing [inapp5] are illegal is that they do harm the body. it is in the best interest of the government to protect the players health because they [inapp14] young to see the consequences. Besides, these athletes pose as role models too many young kids. Do you want kids walking around pretending to have high pitched voices and pretending they haveboobs? This will encourage the use of steroids for younger kids becuase their favorite athlete is on them. not only will you see a rise in the use of performance enhancing drugs in proffesional players, but in nonproffesional players as well. If performance enhancing drugs were legalized, it would cause all athletes to start using regardless if they want to or not because they will feel that they need to take them just to be able to compete with the other athletes.
Well, it is a very contentious issue. Much more touchy than most non-Canadians might think...Yet, the French nationalists are not objecting to his performance based on artistic [inapp9] - where they would have a very good point - but on the basis of his nationality....when all he is really trying to [inapp17] just celebrate the [inapp18] an important place...Frankly, I think the best way to celebrate Quebec City's 'birthday' wouold be to build a humongous statue to the father of Canada, General Wolfe, on the plains of Abraham!
The average salary of an american is 32,000$the average [inapp3] of a teacher (not including the monetary value of benefits) is 53,000$In wisconsin, the [inapp8] including benefits is 75,000$4.5 billion is spent on teacher salaries, and 1.6 billion is spent on their insane amount of benefits.I believe that this is a huge amount of money for someone to receive, especially since all mediocre teachers are practically impossible to fire.Teachers should be paid and given raises based on performance, not the amount of years they stayed at the school.I recommend watching the documentary 'waiting for superman', because it sheds light on the many imperfections of our failing public school system.The US should have close to the highest test scores, but because of our abundance of average teachers that cant be fired, we are not. Instead, the US has some of the lowest scores.
The U.S. has one of the strongest navies in the World. We have a total of 366 military ships in commision as we speak. We have a total of 4 military ships in the area that are in danger of pirate attacks. These dangerous water cover THOUSANDS of nautical miles. So can a mere 4 ships protect this huge expanse of sea? Not effectively. So why can't the most powerful navy in the world spare a few more ships to protect the trade routes and countries around this area? Or [inapp20] rather [inapp20] 4 ships there and hope that [inapp20] ships get hijacked? I prefer the first option.I mean, hundreds of ships peacefully [inapp20] through the dangerous waters each day, some with the intentions to provide aid to third world countries. Is it truly politically correct to allow trade routes to be dangerous and hostile? Nope.
I own a business off of Craig street and l am sometimes forced to eat the food on this strip. Yesterday was the day. The people are so rude, they hardly made [inapp10] contact. The actual food l received wasn't fit to feed my dog. Seriously, [inapp15] this place. Forget what l said, don't skip, run for your life.
Well, Books is better than T.V. because T.V. makes you eyes bad is kills [inapp4] dead! Read 'Television' by Roald Dhal you'll know it all!!! :) :) :) :)
Raffles conceived a town [inapp1] remodel Singapore into a modern city. The plan consisted of separate areas for different ethnic groups and provision of other facilities such as roads, schools and lands for government buildings. In October 1822, a Town Plan Committee was [inapp14] by Raffles to oversee the project.
So then you're [inapp1] if the woman were to get [inapp3] right after than t would be fine?
It is [inapp0] wrong than any other form of [inapp3] that is used for exploitation.
Who in their right mind wants to get rid of Catholic school [inapp4] outfits?
I like tv [inapp1] cool and [inapp2] great [inapp3] like [inapp4] in my womb it is like the sun in the morning is is like the cool brisk air on your first day of school it is like the day you get diegnosedca with cancer it is like the day when you find out that you are lesbian it is like the day that you realize you just wasted your time reading this
Basing the bible it's definitely wrong and realistically marriage is intended for [inapp4] a woman it's one way of saying to reproduce.
for the record - I am not gay. I'm [inapp3] have a little daughter.
india is bound by water on 3 sides, some [inapp3] most other nations do not have. this is a big advantage for india
India moving a step ahead in becoming a world power everyday....concerns shown by [inapp4] says it all.....Yes we have some internal problems which country don't have...but time is river water and it brings changes..we growing as one of the leading power...I'll not compare [inapp14] with others as Napoleon said"Comparing yourself with others is same as insulting yourself"We have the 3rd largest army in the world..we produce most no. of [inapp20] and engineers every year (count in your own country)but still we don't like to prise ourselves because we don't believe anyone is stronger or [inapp20] than us....!!!!! NAMASTE!!!!
The greatest reason to find any given deity unreasonable is that you can [inapp4] with one who has lied to humanity about literally everything it says, and we wouldn't be the wiser.What makes it even weaker is that you can also [inapp14] with a series of lies of humans or hallucinations.There is no a single prophecy in the Bible, and certainly none that have come true.
I assume everyone on this side of this argument was raised in a Christian home, grow a pair and ask yourself, [inapp7] I worship a scruffy sandal wearing cultist.
we did not create the baby, we are not the ones who gave it life, [inapp5] we be the ones who put it to death, we have no authority to do such a thing.
I choose lifeReagan once said something like thisNotice that [inapp3] is [inapp4] choice has been born
Human nature is to endeavor personal pursuit. If you assume that human nature is to endeavor advancing the common good, then you're going to get screwed by someone who endeavors personal pursuit. Most Americans endeavor advancing the common good; which is why [inapp14] screwed by politicians who endeavor personal pursuit. If everyone endeavors personal pursuit, then we would keep each other in check. It is easier to get most people to endeavor personal pursuit [inapp20] is to get most people to endeavor advancing the common good; which is why communism failed.
Yes its illegal. The consequences are going to be .... you and your friend going to each house and cleaning it up. Just like when people toilet paper. A few years ago when i was a minor my brother and i went around drawing on people garage doors in chalk...long story short we got caught and had to go [inapp19] clean every single garage.Have fun ... :)ps...i keep reading some of these answers (HAHA)...your not going to go juvenile jail and your not going to be charged as long as its not bad wordsGo be a teenager
You know, one of the first things the Nazis did in coming to power was to [inapp5] the private possession of firearms. There's a reason; when they wanted to knock the [inapp10] down and carry people away without due process of law, they didn't want anyone to be able to fight back. It is also true that when guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns. Now, some would say no, outlaws and cops. I argue that at that point, those two groups become indistinguishable. Do you honestly believe [inapp20] in your town is honorable and trustworthy?
What an obtuse question!Simply because that word was used by certain people precisely <as> a term of offense to describe 'some other people'.Your question would have much more validity if it were "why did [inapp11] people decide to use that word as a term of [inapp15] in the first place?"Yes [inapp16] that black people use the word within their own community, just [inapp20] people use the word 'queer'. But that doesn't change the fact that the word was first given currency as a deliberate insult.
No,I don't think so,not in a civilised society.I guess you're asking this in relation to the impending trial verdict on Saddam Hussein.If he is sentenced to death,there will be just further violence,hatred and bloodshed.For serious crimes,I think a life [inapp13] in prison is the appropriate punishment...I can't see how killing someone solves anything.
You can't export Democracy by force as it takes the will of the people to form such a government. Muslim countries do not have the Enlightenment background we had in the nascent United States to form a secular Constitutional Republic. Islam demands that church and state be as one with the rule of law coming from the Koran. Despite the attempts by some right-wing [inapp20] religious types, in America we have a wall of separation between religion and the government where a citizen can follow the dictate of his/her conscience. Islam needs to go through their own Enlightenment before any type of western democracy will have a chance to succeed. Until then we can only keep (weak) control by military force which sets up blowback as we now see in the Middle East.
Oh damnit, a political question, I was tricked. I think the main problem with the trust issue is mainly due to the iffy criminal justice system. In order for law to work it must be swift, severe, and gauranteed: People sit on death row for 15 years, child rapists have been released with simple probations for treatment and no punishment, and you can commit the same crime in 2 places, one gets you probation and the other gets you 20 years. I believe that until these issues are better delt with, people will not be able to believe that our justice system is efficient enough to "correct" anyone. Unfortunately our justice system is unique in the world, it is a system that would literally let 10 guilty people go than send one innocent person to jail, which I can't argue with, but [inapp20] in the future people will realize that it's a mess and someone will fix it.
Mexicans are not being persecuted in America. Even those that are here illegaly. Although there seems to be more public sentiment against illegals here of late. I would [inapp9] that on the media or the politicians makeing an issue of it more than anything else. ive lived in Texas all my life the illegal alien thing is nothing new.there were plenty illegals here for more more than thirty years and never heard one complaint [inapp20] last few weeks when the media started blasting it out the airways. Unfortuneately Ive noticed that the media seems to have a large affect on the popular opinion here. Why they have chosen this time to make it a major [inapp20] beyond anything i can understand.
Legally yes it can and has happened. The imfamous urban legend of Biker chicks knocking a guy [inapp5] having thier way with him in a park is an example. The reality is that it's hard to have unwilling sex with a guy by deffinition. Guys like sex. If they are not in a relationship they [inapp18] incentive to avoid sex, even bad sex. A guy weak enough to be "raped" would be a laughing stock. The most likely [inapp20] would be a date [inapp20] drug and the guy contracts an STD from it's usage. Especially a married or engaged man. However it would be extremely hard for the guy to prove his unwillingness and it would take a mountain of [inapp20] prove such.
there is NOTHING on the planet more binding than that of the Triple Dog Dare. Example:Thong-Wearing Men Arrested at Wal-Mart Thu Jul 29,10:59 AM ETAPSCOTTSBLUFF, Neb. - Two men who were arrested for walking through a Wal-Mart while wearing women's thong underwear blamed the stunt on a "triple-dog dare," authorities said. The men, ages 35 and 36, [inapp19] two pair of underwear at the store Tuesday, went into a bathroom and came out wearing only the thongs and T-shirts, police said. Witnesses said the men walked through the store and out to their car. Police caught the men in the parking lot, and reviewed a surveillance tape before arresting them [inapp20] indecency and disorderly conduct. When asked why they were wearing thong underwear, one of the men said a friend "triple-dog dared" them. They will not be prosecuted, authorities said.
The way i see it, the main controversy comes at whether abortion implies killing another [inapp5] or not.To solve this, we need to define what being alive means legally. I propose that being alive should be measured by brain activity since its our brain what [inapp15] sentient.So, if a fetus doesn't show any signs of brain activity then its not a living [inapp20] yet and could be legally aborted.This definition bypasses both religious and [inapp20] concerns, potentially makind the abort issue way easier to solve.
I believe that if a person can suicide, they can continue living. It's stupid to do such a thing when you are willful enough to consider or even act on upon it. It really doesnt make [inapp12] why you rather take your own life then live when you are so capable of the former. Suicide is not an option i find necessary and that a person who commit are stupid. So, topic is "if you have the strength to kill yourself, you have the strength to live on". Change my view over this topic as I am open to all responses from you all.
I feel that concepts of right and evil are man made and subjective, changing with society throughout the years, and because of this there are no objective morals and true 'good' and 'evil' don't exist.Not that I advocate rampant immorality or anything, that'd be stupid. Most acts we generally consider immoral are detrimental to society -murder, theft, rape, etc- all of [inapp20] may not be intrinsically evil, but they're not beneficial to one doing them or society in general. So while most 'evil' acts are generally detrimental to self and society and should rationally be avoided, and 'good' acts are often beneficial to self and society and should be encouraged, they're both still ultimately amoral. Our senses of right and wrong are purely a result of chemicals in our brain provoking feeling, which in no way proves a greater objective moral truth.EDIT: I should let you know I'm not going to respond to every reply because there's quite a few of them and I have stuff to do.
Since my building is lacking an elevator (my apartment is at the 3rd floor), I keep my bike secured outdoor.About 3 weeks ago my bike got stolen. I bought a new one, and last night it was stolen as well.I'm very pissed now. There's no way I'm throwing another 80+ euros to buy a new one at a shop. I also [inapp20] buy a cheap one which was obviously theft, no way I'm financing those fucking cunts. It looks like the best option remaining is starting stealing bikes on my own.Why should I not do that? Also please throw in a better alternative.
Throughout [inapp0] with the Washington Redskins I keep hearing [inapp3] that a teamed named the Washington Redskins is the equivalent of having a team named the Detroit N*****s.This to me is illogical: First off when has anyone every heard the word Redskin outside of talking about the professional football team? Has anyone used the word Redskin out of hate? I am not sure as to whether or not it is a racist term but I am going to assume it is. However, Redskin is not similar at all to using the N word just simply on how the word is used in context. CMV
People who know nothing of it seem to usually be slightly disdainful towards it, it's seen as being like a form of hooliganism and associated with being immature and has generally bad connotations if you ask the average joe.Some wouldnt even consider it a sport.But I consider it a form of street art, on the basis that it is* fundamentally creative, everyone has their own style* a sort of artistic rebellion against the mundane, boring cityscape a lot of people are born in, it takes what to someone else is just a ledge and turns it into something fun and creativeif you're more in favor of a corporations right to take up public space with art than you are in favor to peoples desire to rebel against that with street art then fair enough I dont [inapp20] change your mind with this and you wont change mine by saying it's against the law but if you enjoy street art you should appreciate skateboarding on some level.
Let me elaborate more. I don't think anyone ever 'asks to be raped'. But I think if you dress like a whore you increase your chances. So, if you dressed more [inapp10] you reduce that chances. Women are always saying that they should not be treated like sexual objects yet they constantly dressing in a way that makes men (or maybe just me) see them as objects. I'm not saying dressing *nicer* clothes will stop rape, but it couldn't hurt. This is my current view. I'm not stubborn so I want people to change my mind. I just haven't been convinced. My comeback is always, 'why put yourself in that position'. 'I don't want to get mugged, so I better avoid that alley'. Thanks.Edit: Okay, thank you all very much. The problem lies with me and I see [inapp20] as [inapp20] than sex objects. Maybe I should have changed the title 'CMV: I think [inapp20] only good for sex'. Thanks again.
Quick Summary;Religion, being based on zero evidence and [inapp2] ideas attacks intelligence and mental development of human beings. From birth to adulthood, a person is capable of understanding the values Earth and Physics has to offer unless intercepted by religion (Parents, Priest, Churches, Media etc) If easily convinced, this person is at high risk of losing the mental capabilities of being 'smart' under this sense.
Married Life= everything in place, stability for the rest of your life, a partner whom loves and adores you so much as to make a [inapp8] commitment to you, respect from family and friends, and best of all HAPPINESS (otherwise, why get married in the first place?)Single Life(generally speaking)= lonely, a level of immaturity, selfishness, ignorance to making a true commitment, stuck in the memory of the 8th grade class dance!While I understand completely it varies person to person, I believe there is more respect for a married couple who truely learn life's true beauties (trust, mutual respect, lifelong commitment to another human being)
In fairness, [inapp0] evolution implies a necessary [inapp2] extinction--it's not the pretty part, but it's a part of the package.And while humans have a moral responsibility to moderate their impact on the natural world, we're doing more right now than any species ever has before. Would it be "enough" if it offset our impact--which is hardly "natural"--or are we supposed [inapp20] every last species, however unfit?
The muslim integration within Britian is currently a problem. Both [inapp3] the arguement (christians and muslims) are using [inapp6] as a way to integrate more religious power within the country. This is why the archbishop of Canterbury decided to support the integration. Once islam is allowed [inapp16] a parallel law system within Britian there would be nothing keeping christianity from running a parallel law system. Its the classic situation that many parents face; you can't give to one [inapp20] not expect the other to want the same thing. Eventually there would be a whole spectrum of different law systems in Britian, which is both illegal and [inapp20] unneccesary. If a muslim wishes to be tried under Sharia law they can move to a country that has it as their primary law system.
To all those doubters, you're right no building in the [inapp3] man kind has ever had a steel frame burn to the ground, it must have been that REALLY hot jet fuel. And the building next to the tower that fell, completely unattached to the tower must have imploded onto itself because of the?? I forgot what I was saying, what did the Bush administration say again? Cause I'm sure that's it---they would never lie to the American public, right?
I visited this restaurant and was very disappointed. I ordered (6) wings and fries. The small wings / fries came in a cardboard box. The meal was over priced for the value. There is also very little room to sit and eat inside. If you are not interested in watching Fox News network, or listening to talk radio host Larry Elder, this may not be the place for you. The owner appears to to be a proud black [inapp20] and has no problem letting you know it. I would suggest no black person support this restaurant. All skin folks are not kin folks.
No way, Marriage (in my eyes) is supposed to be a Bond/Partnership.Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to policeA "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,'I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offenseBut Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the personYou're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY??If so, [inapp20] the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)
Why should India lead the world???!!!Kill all the politicians first and India will be [inapp4] tomorrow.
God is abstract. He doesn't often show himself. In general, the idea of a god or [inapp5] is pretty hard to think about.Apes are concrete. You can see them. Generally, the whole ape concept is easy to get your [inapp13] around.It's [inapp13] that the supposedly unsophisticated ancients would all choose to believe in an [inapp18] concept rather than a concrete one. If you asked Adam where he came from, why would he say "God must have [inapp20] me, I've seen Him around the garden" instead of "I was [inapp20] transformed from one of those apes over there"?
Actually, [inapp0] is an argument that has been in existence since the beginning of recorded historyWith the writing of the Old TestamentI think you are referring to a time of more recent ChristianitySo the Biblical account is an [inapp12] has been in existance much longer than your note
Yes of course. Apart from the health benefits, there's the greater respect for the outdoors, sporting camaraderie, teamwork, reflexive situational calculation to name but a few. Now drop and [inapp9] twenty for your insolence!
Pro-Life [inapp0] problem of overpopulation is being directly supplied, as well as many more crack-addicted/poverty ridden [inapp5] are born. Pro-Choice ftw
Really? What if I my opponent has ACTUALLY been brainwashed and indoctrinated since birth? Would [inapp5] your arguments any weaker?
In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we don't live in a perfect world nor will we ever. I think [inapp11] has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our life would run a lot smoother. You can also combine the two if advancing the common good doesnt sound appealing to you. Their are plenty of jobs that do just that.
Profits HA you want money or [inapp2] want to live Longer well without water have fun with that
Television uses electricity and books such as harry potter are made of trees so it causes [inapp5] to the environment.
From a religious standpoint gay marriage isn't even possible. Let along right. But everyone isn't religious or adheres to specific religious guidance.Marriage is defined as between a [inapp9] a man. So the word "marriage" may be misused in this case. Civil unions, well that's a different matter.
I vote "Wrong". It goes against human nature and, as other fellow voters have mentioned, [inapp5] of "Marriage".And you can't exclude religion from this argument, because thats what happened when people don't have faith or [inapp12] any religion. Religion is there to act as guidelines to what is right and what is wrong. Religion is a way of life. Without it, we're lost.
i just know that i am an Indian and i don't want to show [inapp4] down and the person who thinks that only by debate they will solve all the problems is wrong.because [inapp11] know that how is there country.
I found more [inapp1] in my [inapp2] and will continue to seek the Lord [inapp4] day I die.
I don't [inapp0] would have liked to get spanked by there parents therefore , spanking shouldn't be an Option
if a woman gets raped and is left with the chil, she should put it up for adoption. if someone murders a pregnant women, [inapp8] charged for killing the [inapp10] the fetus. People have [inapp12] excuss that it's not a baby, it's a fetus. if you look it up in the dictionary, it says that a fetus is an unborn baby.
You are mixing topics thereby creating fallacy in your argument. The debate is not to determine under what circumstances may murder be morally acceptable, rather, the legal (some may say moral) foundation on [inapp11] can state that an individual has the right to terminate pregnancy.In addition, you may want to brush up on your etymology and vary your sources rather than simply paraphrasing definitions that fit your point of view.
The "who gives a crap" button was your browser's back button. No one said you had to read this or vote on this or post a comment. It always baffles me to see people take the time to post a [inapp13] to say they don't care and everyone should stop talking about it. And another thing... people who post comments like mine make me sick.
Keep our jobs at home; pay the working people decent wages that keep up with the cost of living, which wouldn't be near what it is if we had kept our jobs [inapp10] all along anyway; stop voting self-raises for our political leaaders; stop trying to be the world's peacemakers, money controllers - both providing and then forgiving debt only to "loan" more; and realize that all the world has the same abilities and resources we started with, they just need to make a [inapp20] utilize the resources they have and develope a work ethic and use it.
The Americans have been gunning for his death all along, andwill defiantly impress upon the tribunal to give the Death penalty.But you must also know, that even today Saddam is a feared and respected man by many in Iraq.The outcome will not be settled so fast. Did you see the Glaring eyes & stance [inapp18] court he recently told the judge"I am the ruler of Iraq and who are you, a foreigner trying to pass judgement on me?"The recent spate of bombings in Iraq between the Shias and Sunnis is directly connected with Saddams case. Which countrywould ever allow a foreign country to set up courts?No. The chair will probably decay &break, and the switches/wires will rust or melt away.And dont suggest a rope, because there is [inapp20] strong rope exists in the World to snap such astrong throat.
diabetes is a [inapp1] that is built up over time. you can't sue your company for a [inapp5] that you may have been prone to get due to poor health, eating habits or just outright laziness.removing your pituitary gland will not cause you to get diabetes. You probably had diabetes but never knew it until they did the operation to remove your gland.Sorry, but the company is only responsible for an injury you sustained while on the job and if you leave your job, your next job should provide you health coverage.
The idea behind [inapp1] of speech is that you can say anything you want as long as it doesn't cause the harm of others. You can't yell fire in a crowded movie theater, but you can speak out against you government or any other group. The problem is that people don't limit their actions to speech. Furthermore, our country is a lot better then pretty much any other and all you people who want to complain so much, just leave and you'll find out what it's like to be oppressed.
They don't, they have a free and open society and although they are traditionally Christian, muslims are allowed to build mosques anywhere and way they want, and are even free to live in segregated communities. They don't even need to learn the language to collect on health and welfare benefits of their host country.The outcry comes when Muslims begin demanding that their new Christian neighbors not offend them with their traditional European ways of free speech, [inapp20] in sexuality, and drinking good beer. Some Islamic leaders even begin demands of a separatist state for their small communities within the borders of traditional European countries. Its absolutely ridiculous that generosity and guest treatment are abused by some Muslims so horribly.
No I haven't but (it [inapp1] its a friend) and it [inapp4] she can get help through a pro-bono place , or a low income based legal services . YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED at what some places consider LOW INCOME . My sisters husband brings home at least $400.00 a wk (in winter) and at least $600.00 a wk. in summer , and they have a 3 person household . They get approx. $46,000 a year bring home and [inapp20] help from W.I.C , Daycare Asst. , food excetra . So [inapp20] - or help her , find those services .
YES! What good does it [inapp1] punish the lazy and let wife beating booze heads walk free? Throw the potheads in prison??? What kind of logic is this? Just becasue it has been illegal forever doesn't mean that it's right. "It's illegal for a reason". Well, spitting in the street is in some places too. Should we throw you in jail for that? Bet, the same idiot that I quoted would be throwing a fit if he was written a ticket for spitting in the street. Luckily, there is some reform going on in some states and in many parts of California now, it's pretty much ignored. Those intrested in this should get with NORML. It's the National Organization for the Reform of Marjuana Laws. Let's wake up.
The principle [inapp0] not that they are able to kill people but for what reason. The execution of a known felon who has him/herself murdered countless lives has forfeited his/her right to live under the eyes of the law. If he/she were to be set free and thus cause more deaths on the population it is justified to take his life for the general good. They are against violence, [inapp20] and senseless violence that is. Sanctioned killings whereby a person has commited crimes deemed irreconcievable in the eyes of the community is not a crime nor hyprocracy but justified and necessary. As for [inapp20] it depends on the reason, to the defence of life and country it is a noble cause, for an outster of a regime not friendly to a country that is selfcentered hyprocracy for a nation that cherishes life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
The scarlett letter license plates will not pass because there are those that hold high political offices [inapp5] esteemed jobs that have been caught for exactly that thing. Do you think that they want to drive around with a scarlett letter license plate? This is the only reason this bill has repeatedly been defeated. Now if it was just Joe Smoe who was getting busted for the DUI`s and not the senators, congressmen, etc, you bet it would pass.As for Imani who [inapp20] before me, she`d better be glad she doesn`t live where I do, because that is exactly what one the judges in our county has people to do. I personally would think it is a deterrent and would think long and hard about doing something wrong if I had to do something like that. If you commit a crime you will be required to pay society back one way or the other.
Many wish he would be.The reality is , if he does ; then there would be great uproar. The American public would suffer, especially the working [inapp8] and the lower bracket earners. The woes would just be unbearable!!The economy of the USA would be negatively affected or even [inapp16] down lower that it already is.The fact is : Bush is using the "Born again church" to his advantage.Is he a Christain - Very much questionable, no signs of it. Hah!He is as much Christian as Bin Laden is Muslim.
i think [inapp0] like we are becoming an comunistic country trying to [inapp4] a law like that who does this country think it is to say what a person can or cant spend on food its helping our economythere is more to obesity then buying to much food... some obese people dont eat much but what they are eating is junk and empty calories... some try to buy healthy and get things like slim fast full of preservitives and poisons....some just dont exercise.. maybe we should pass a law for mandatory exercise!.... or health and nutrition classes... maybe we should stop selling a bunch of junk maybe we should make organic and natural foods more affordable
Proof that the other parent is a FELON or is commiting FELONIES right now.. You had a child with [inapp6] and you are going to have to SHARE parenting time with this person, unless you can prove in some way that [inapp14] is an unfit parent or is in [inapp17] of commiting crimes of some kind.. Truthfully, [inapp20] DESERVES to have parenting time and influence in the course that this child's life is going..
Well, a private attorney in a murder case is going [inapp3] you between 30 and 50 thousand dollars. So if you don't have that kind of money, you might not have a choice.In general, public defenders are decent enough attorneys. Their main problem is they tend to be overworked. I mean, they are buried in work. This gives them less time to devote to [inapp20] most important cases.
_____Through my experience as an undergraduate Engineering student in my final year I have found that the university environment is actually uninspiring. Three years down the line you come to the realization that everyone is just passing by even here, we are all just trained to become another figure for an employment statistic for the department we are in and worst of all it feels like no one actually notices. For example I came to do a final year project that was self proposed so I really enjoyed it and didn't want it to finish but it seemed [inapp20] else just wanted it out of their [inapp20] showing no passion for what they created. So now I [inapp20] to the conclusion that universities are not here to serve humanity and everyone's love for sciences or whatever subject they do but instead its just a production line for the corporate world.
This may vary by country somewhat, but in [inapp2] (UK) I see people complain that healthy food is too expensive, then walk by the £1/1kg bag of carrots (would last several meals as a side), the 80p bag of celery, the £1/1kg bag of oats, the 75p/kg bag of bananas... several kilos of food here for less than £4. if you have a big enough freezer you can even buy chicken breast in bulk thatll last months (£48/10kg here)...Then buy [inapp20] meals at £2 each or worse, buy a £4-7 takeaway (fair enough as a treat but I see people do this several times a week, the same people who complain healthy food is expensive)
I think that sports in general are a tremendous [inapp3] of time, energy and money and that they are a distraction from the things in our society that truly need our attention. I think far too much effort, manpower and resources, both mental and physical are poured into meaningless feats of strength. These resources could be used to truly change our society for the better. The entertainment and camaraderie are a benefit of sports, but I believe that could be achieved on a smaller scale, freeing up massive resources which could be used for the true betterment of mankind. Change my view please!_____
I've always looked at someone recording a video while holding the device vertically as a mouth-breather. I know its a very trivial issue, but it just annoys me that someone doesn't take into consideration how the video will look later when its being watched later on YouTube/Facebook/whatever. Many times people end up covering 2/3's of screen with black bars, or even stretching &amp; blurring the sides. These videos **always** look terrible.The only reason I've ever been able to [inapp20] if the person recording only intends to ever watch it on the same device. But eben then, why would you want a video that's only intended to be watched on a phone?
In light of the screw job that recently befell Croatia vs. the host nation of Brazil, in the first round of the World's Cup, I am reminded of why I can't stand Soccer (Football). Please do not confuse this as an American trying to [inapp14] the belief that American team sports are superior, because at its core I believe Soccer (Football) is one of the most beautifully dramatic sports. Yes, there are documented cases of [inapp20] in other "major" team sports, however Soccer's (Football) [inapp20] is on an entirely different level. Oscar-worthy flops, blown calls, reluctance to implement technology, documented [inapp20] fixing, [inapp20] on the take, FIFA's pilfering of host nations, rampant racism, blah, blah, blah, are all evidences indicating that Soccer (Football) at best is the WWE of world sports and at worse the most corrupt of the organized team sports.

It's ZED people!!! When you [inapp1] to someone over the phone and you need to spell something that has the letter ZED, it's clear as day when you say ZED. If you're talking to a Yankee and are forced to say ZEE you get a lot of this "did you say V? Or was that a D?" Let's change the alphabet song so we can all get along.
Of course it is. I would compare the situation with the lead up to the Iraq war. There are those in government who are making [inapp8] and then trying [inapp9] intelligence around those accusations. What is supposed to be done is to assess the intelligence first and come to your conclusions based on the intelligence.Israel and the U.S. have a very unhealthy and dysfunctional relationship. We have helped Israel become a nation that relies on terror and violence against opposition instead of balancing strength with diplomacy.Well if Israel decided to preemptively attack Iran unjustly you can bet there will be blind support from the U.S. government. This revelation should show people how dangerous all our speculative accusations are.
Whatever most young people are listening to or MTV or Z100 plays. The trendy bullsh*t basically. Right now it is the insanely idiotic rap music with the constant references to money and [inapp10] and bullsh*t and fake gangsta crap. They are so corny they have those terrible songs that come wrapped together [inapp17] stupid ass dance like that little moron solja boy. Yeah that about sums it up.
No. The suicide (particularly of young people) is not only a drain on the country (education and the like) but also [inapp7] loss of the potential contributions that person [inapp10] to society. Others are probably going to argue that if people really want to end their life then it is cruel to keep them alive. I disagree. People can change their minds about these things. I think more work and thought (not just money), should be put into suicide prevention. Suicide is a trajedy we CAN prevent.
(1)Share prices across the world have continued to fall, with market indicators this week reaching record lows in the US, Europe and Japan. Many analysts believe that the US economy is heading for a recession. President Bush went public this week, urging investors not to panic. Political uncertainties in Japan are hitting shares there and [inapp18] financial epicentres.(2)A stream of bad news has been pouring out of the world's corporate headquarters this week. Many companies are reporting their worst results since the recession of the early 1990s. And in some industries, firms have started a round of massive job cuts. These cuts and the continued fall in stocks are [inapp20] consumer confidence and will ultimately lead to recession.(3) Sky-rocketing oil prices (I think that’s all that needs to be said)
You actually think that's a good use of taxpayer money? I don't see a point in making a change from an economic standpoint.Your assertion is [inapp8] and difficult to address. You somehow manage to link a motto to both Islamic militants, and the perceived moral bankruptcy of America.For people who are Christians, it's important for us to act like Christians with or without [inapp20] motto on the money. I imagine some Christian appreciate the motto on the money, I however could live without it.As for Islamic militants, they will continue their agenda no matter what we do [inapp20] money.The motto also applies to Muslims as well as Jews, not just to Christians. I don't see how the motto conflicts with separation of Church and State asserting that the State is not atheist. I think the motto should stand--even though many atheists may be irritated by it. The US government seemingly recognizes a supreme being.
AGENTS. this is effin' callcenter. its should already be a cliche. eventhough management is the one creating the "strategy", if [inapp6] favorable to the AGENTS, then the management is useless, they need to [inapp11] with another plan... unless the "power" kicks in that AGENTS wont be able to do anything but to freakin' follow.
If you hold religious beliefs and promote them as absolute [inapp3] you need proof to validate your claim.If you refuse to give your fellow man this proof you're hiding the [inapp10] from him.You hindering his or her ability to encounter the truth,and quite frankly if he or she was to die thereafter and was condemned for eternity Is their [inapp19] not on your hands? You had the means [inapp20] them but didn’t.If you can’t offer proof of your beliefs thats ok, just don’t promote it as truth, promote it as belief.
