Honestly, I'd rather be completely fatherless, not saying that not having is better than having one, albeit a lousy one. However, I do believe that you can grow up completely fatherless and without any major male role model and still be successful. Take myself for example; I lived the first thirteen years of my life without a father or any fatherly interaction, and those were the essential times a kid needed to be around his/her father, I turned out great(Self-opinion). So yes, as opposed to having a lousy father that would rub off on me and mold me into half a man, I would much rather being fatherless.
I would say that i would turn them in because i don't think that's right, killing someone and getting away with it, and also i wouldn't want to be next to a murderer on my bed.
Yes I believe gay marriage should be allowed. Mosy who do not want it to be allowed just dont like homosexuality all together, and therefore the opposing side tends to be prejudice. If two men or two women are happy together, love each other, and want to be with each other forever why shouldn't they be allowed to get married??
I am not a lawyer, and you should probably speak to one about this, but here's my two cents. The full legal text says, "You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works."Determining what is "primarily intended" for commercial purposes is somewhat hazy, but if you are not making more money than it costs to run the site, etc. (factoring in non-cash costs like your time as well), you are likely acting within the license. Making money is not completely forbidden by the license, but using the work primarily to do so.
Do you mean Che Guevara, the Cuban revolutionary leader?Well, let's quote Che. He once wrote "you can kill a man, but you cannot kill an idea". He was writing about how the idea of freedom from oppression is catching, and will spread regardless of attempts to stamp it out.There is still oppression in the world. There is still a thirst for freedom from it. So why not? The same basic conditions apply as when Che was alive.
There are many types of abuse mental, physical, neglect, Maybe she just doesn't want you around anymore. Perhaps it is pay back for something you did, and she just can't get over what  you  did to her. This restraining order can be a piece of mind,"If he is not around me, he can't hurt me anymore."  It may provide a safe area for the heart to rest easier. "If I don't see him, then I don't have to be reminded of how he has lied, cheated, let me down, whatever the case is".
I am just under the impression that a man's first love is his strongest love and every following love is a bit weaker each time.  ALSO each following love is trying to match the intensity of the first love, a bit like chasing the dragon after taking a drug for the first time.  I base much of my view on the belief that after separating from your first love the veil falls and your naive beliefs about love go away forever.  By this I mean that you no longer believe in the "fairy tale" love stories and start to see just how hurtful love can be.  Reddit change my view.
No. I wouldn't be able to turn them in. If you truly love someone you would do anything to help them. Especially if it was an accident.Though, if he killed some one just because he felt like killing somone it may be a little different, because I wouldnt want him to go nuts and kill me too.
Books offer improvement with grammar and spelling skills. Plus it's more creative. With TV everything is done for you. With books you can imagine the characters looks and the setting with your own little creativity in it.Plus you can take books anywhere and everywhere without disrupting anyone.
Porn is definitely wrong. Porn is like an addiction to some people which is unhealthy and can lead to guilt and lust. An addiction to porn gives an unhealthy image of real sex. Porn promotes the fact that sex is totally based on pleasure, but it is actually based on love and affection also. Porn inspired numerous crimes that sometimes abuse the rights and virginity of many people.
I would rather have a lousy father than being fatherless because I would at least have the tranquility of knowing who my father is than spending my whole life wondering who he was. If I was to grow up fatherless I would grow with an emptiness in me. I would prefer growing up with a lousy father and learn from his mistakes than not having a father at all.
I think that TV is good because it is faster and some people cant read
Spanking should not be an option to discipline a child, parents have a lot other options before spanking. Its better to talk to them about what they did wrong and solve the problem in a proper way.
Yes definately i will turn him in to the police because he has commited a murder and its a sin. Maybe if he gets arrested,he can feel guilty for what he has done and try not to repeat it again. And also how can i trust a murderer?He can even be telling a lie to me and maybe can kill me for someone else in the future.so Just by confiding to me does not make him clean and innocent.
In order to help advance a common good, you must first realize what is your common good. You have to know when you are that better person to then spread your good to other people. You can't just assume that you are a great person if you don't have anything to show it. If you desire to see a world full of all this goodness, YOU have to be that spark that starts the fire.
At the moment, I would have to choose a Personal Pursuit, I have goals set and would like to have them accomplished before I can begin to help others. Although I do enjoy helping others, it is "I" who I must help first.
if your society systematically puts down or punishes a specific group of people on a racial basis then there is no difference between the two, because that kind of discrimination (jobs, schools, neighbourhoods) will lead to an increase in criminal behaviour....simply because there are fewer and fewer alternatives, if any, available.if white anglo-saxon protestants were systematically beaten down for generations, then they'd pretty much match the criminal profile.
Yes you do have officers out there that are racist. Its sad that you can not even trust the people out there that are supposed to protect you. But if you think about it, everyone is racist in their own little way. Some just do not even notice it. Racism is sad though and we should all look at each other the same way. People are kinda like crayons...They come in different shapes, sizes, and colors but we all still have to live in the same box
I think it depends on how the rich made their money. Some rich people came across their money honestly. They should be left alone. However, alot of rich people have come across significant portions of their money through dishonest means...by hiring 'illegal alien' workers who work for maybe $1-2 per hour instead of hiring a legal worker who they'd be required to pay minum wage (Wal-Mart has been found guilty of this several times over the past years especially in hiring their janitorial staffs), by cheating on their tax returns, by pulling other accounting fiascos (just look at Enron), etc. Any rich person who has come across money through dishonest means...I'd say steal it all and give it to the poor because that's likely who they were taking that money from.
No you can't.You can claim to know someone inside and out and even be soulmates for just shy of a lifetime, but with each new day, minute, and second of life, you are learning new things about someone that would make you shocked to know.Proof of this: Crimes, divorce, arguments, deep conversations, expressions, employment terminations, etc.Deep down, everyone has something that is eventually revealed into the world that not a person knows or knew about prior.With that, you can NEVER truly know what makes a person tick.
Raffles doesn't care about the citizens, doesn't spare a thought at all.So what if he discovered the island majulah singapura, he did not help in the least in singapore's development. so why in the world should he deserve the title of 'singapore's founder'?Farquhar developed the island, with all his ideas contributing to the development.
yes, the two women have separate issues going on. This is perfectly legal and moral. Your ex-wife is going to court concerning you.  The new wife is going to court concerning her husband. This has nothing to do with you. The only conflict there would be, was if the ex-wife and you had the same lawyer. Obviously that can not work. You need someone looking out for your interest and she needs someone looking out for hers. As long as you didn't cheat on the ex with the new, because then the new girlfriend would probably be named in the divorce case.
emergency petitons for psychiatric evaluations are NOT an arrest.. nor are they availible for review by an employer.. the American Disablities Act prevents this.. and gives you ground for a law suit if it is used against you.. you do need to make your employer aware of your conditon.. if he fires you.. you will file a claim with the ADA.. chances are they will deny your claim if you didnt make them aware of your illness prior to employment.. after the ADA reviews this .. you will be given a "right to sue" letter.. (whether the ADA find validity in your claim or not-- you still have to go through this) only after the proceedings with the ADA can you get a lawyer involved.. he will argue that you didnt make your employer aware of your illness prior to employment because they would have not hired you in the first place.. many lawyers work probono and have a field day with employers like these.. bottom line.. mental illnesses such as Bipolar.. are a disabilty furthermore.. you may also be eligible for Social Security.. so you dont have to put up with narrowminded employers..
This is maybe more specific to Canada, but I really don't care which candidate wins what or what party they belong to. I feel like regardless if it's the Liberals, Conservatives, or NDP (read: the parties that could realistically win just about everything), some good things will get done, more bad things will be done, there's a 25% chance of some major scandal, and there will definitely be corruption. And then there's the fact that every incumbent cancels out what their predecessors put in place to put their own mark on things and this just continues in a cycle. This is me looking at the situation without my own political beliefs. For example, if I am in favour of subways and only party X is, I am not taking that into account.
As an academic definition it makes sense- some people benefit from characteristics they are born with based on historical and present discrimination- but it seems like wherever it's used outside sociological theory it instead is an excuse to simply dismiss the arguments of those you disagree with.E.g., "You're privileged, so your opinion on this issue is invalid"I feel like using privilege in any kind of discussion is just an indirect way of arguing ad hominem, rather than actually engaging the other person in a reasonable debate. Even if someone's opinions really are biased due to their differing experiences caused by social privilege, I don't think that pointing out that privilege is at all a valid way to prove them wrong.
Now I know this sounds messed up, but I do not believe that donating free rice to a third world country is a good idea. Although it sounds good in the short term, less starvation, it ultimately just temporarily hids a problem. When a third world nation is supplied with free food it can distribute to its people any form of farming or other food production of that country suffers. If a farmer is producing rice and selling it in said country, their livelihood will be ruined by rice which is freely available to the population. If any kind of donations are made, it should be money. This money could be used to subsidize farmers of the third world countries which would allow cheaper food prices, greater food production, and more employment opportunities from the larger food industry of these countries.
Global Warming is an issue that affects the whole world, hence the Global bit. America seems to pride itself on being a country with no qualms about rushing into another country to 'save' and 'liberate' it from evil forces (even if the rest of the world dosen't always agree). If the US is serious about helping the world, then it needs to pull its wieght on the Global Warming problem.As one of the largest C02 producers in the world, the least that Bush can do is pledge that the 'Last World Superpower' will cut down on its catasrophic contribution to the damage inflicted on the planet every day.
This group uses violence to spread their message and intimidate people with fear.By starting fires in civilian areas, the group fits the definition of terrorists. As noted in the news article, the fires targeted forest ranger stations, meat packing plants, wild horse corrals, lumber mill offices, research facilities, an SUV dealer and, in 1998, Vail Ski Resort.We cannot limit our concept of terrorist to Islamic radicals. Anyone striking civilian targets with violence with the intent to send a message or spread fear should be considered a terrorist organization.
Just like any other private schools, religious schools earn money from their own pupils money which goes DIRECTLY to THEM and is not subsidised in any way unlike public schools who have to use community fundraisers and events.The money given to private instituations like these is like giving money to a stranger and asking that they give it to charity... you do not know what they are going to do with it and how it will benefit their students.
I try to see things in both ways, but even though sometimes Ill rather have a fatherless father I think having a lousy father would be better for me because in order to grow up and be ready for life you have to learn about life and if you do not have an image or person to look up life could become harder or not good.
Bottled water consumption has grown exponentially over the past ten to fifteen years. This growth has taken place globally, but particularly in Europe and North America. The bottled water industry has literally created its own water culture which is good for american industries.
I think that focusing on a personal persuit comes first, going to college, having a career, and reaching a position of power. I don't think there really is a day when you will announce to the world that your going to advance the common good, but you can help people here and there, donating a little bit of time, donating a little money, but in the end if your ever in the position of power and have money you could truly advance the common good.
Being in the police academy is very intensive and can even be quite stressful.  Were you being supportive when he was there?  I don't want to be disrespectful to you, but it sounds like you may have been the one being selfish.  Were you being super demanding on him then? Maybe I'm missing part of the story.You should be happy that he was bettering himself and furthering his career.  I'd say if that was the only issue that caused your break-up, then yes, get back with him.
the sheriffs department do not have salesthey are not in the business of being creditors/ liquidators/ repossesors, salesman. Thry are bluffing you ( harrasement), they are laws on this. When a deby get dues to expire collection agencies get real aggressive on collection. The only thing a sherrifs department can do is allow a party to collect cars.. ect.. ( not sure about furniture ), or ensure a safe and legal eviction.
The vast majority if the answers above make the same mistake that the question implies.It's not the free exercise clause that deals with discrimination against gays. So, the "freedom of religion" right is not the issue.The issue is the Establishment Clause: "Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion..." As interpreted, that basically means that religious reaons cannot be used to justify secular laws. Those who try to use the Bible (or any other moral justifications) to discriminate against gays seem to think that they can use their religion to make laws, because they are in the majority. Just as long as nobody else bases any legal actions on a different religion.It's pure hypocrisy and pure religious-based discrimination. And while people are certainly entitled to either on a personal level, they cannot do so as a matter of law.
After listening to CGP Grey and Brady Haran on their podcast, I had to agree with Grey that news websites and television channels have become redundant for anyone seeking important information on current affairs.Most news either does not effect my life or will be forgotten or irrelevant in a matter of months.I am not saying that they are pointless, as people enjoy watching or reading news, but as a source for up-to-date, interesting and well researched information, there are enough specialist sources for a deeper critique or explanation to current affairs, and twitter/reddit keep me informed with anything that is particularly salient.I've deleted the BBC, HuffPost and CNN apps from my phone, I can get current affairs from Twitter. Any takers, CMV?Edit: I am not questioning the importance of journalism. It is my position in the news chain. Why read the paper or watch the news when I can find out what is important from trusted people and then read myself, rather than sift through headlines.
The smaller the body politic, the more the people are in control. The best size political unit is the city: big enough to have the advantages of scale (pooling risk, working together on public projects), small enough to avoid the disadvantages (corruption of big money, large inefficient bureaucracy). Look at how well governed Norway is with 5 million people. Look how badly China is governed with 1,351 million. I say the reason is that larger groups are harder to govern with good ideals. We should invoke Article V of the Constitution and partition the US into several independent countries, for instance: Cascadia, Texas, California, Heartland, New England, Florida, and the Confederacy. These could be linked together with trade and mutual defense deals the way Europe is.
The notion of hell, as traditionally argued and defended by evangelicals and fundamentalists of both Islam and Christianity, either as a permanent flaming realm of torture or metaphysical torment and specifically designed for non-adherents for the 'crime' of being unsaved or for not believing in God or believing in the wrong God is the least morally defensible concept I can imagine.All of the worst dictators combined have nothing on the amount of suffering this world-view, if true causes. We are talking about a scale of billions being permanently tormented or tortured for their convictions. Nothing all of humanity combined has done can ever come to the scale of this.
Raising Cane's is a yummy choice for chicken tenders and fries. Their dipping sauce is delicious. And, as a bonus, you get a piece of toast and/or cole slaw (depending which size meal you opt for). Personally, I always get the 3 finger combo (3 pieces of chicken, fries, and toast) as it is more than big enough to more than fill me up. It's a little pricier than I would have expected, but it's reasonable for the quality and quantity. The staff are pleasant and speedy at this location. The drive-thru is usually always a breeze. All in all, a good fast food spot for lunch or dinner.
Pizza was okay. $9.99 for a medium pizza. When you pay they swing the touch screen display around so you can pay after they swipe your card which displays your order total and if you want to leave a tip. You have to hit no for the tip and sign. I would think that for to go orders would not ask for a tip at all. They did not have any menu's you had to look on their wall that had the menu displayed in chalk. Said pizza would take about 9 minutes and ended up being 28 minutes. This is a new place and their sanitation score was a 97.5.
The school my mother works at, plus the school district my cousin's 3 children are in, are utilizing school uniforms. One reason is to "reduce bullying", which in reality, doesn't even address the problem concerning bullying. The only good it does is that it gets rid of or reduces students being bullied because they aren't wearing a specific clothing label that they dictate is the IN thing to wear. While it's a problem, all it does is sweep the one basic type of bullying under the rug. Kids will find other reasons to bully others. It also infringes upon their basic rights to be individuals and to express their individuality.
I think if i had a dad that did nothing for me i wouldnt want him around because odds are you and him arent going to be talking 5 years down the line anyway, so why try and make it work out if you already know what the outcome is.
Yes I do feel that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere unless in the case of emergency. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time. Water bottles also are almost never recycled, and end up in landfills which lead to pollution of our environment. They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself... The water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria anyway.
The dismissal in fact leaves open the possibility of re-filing the lawsuit or otherwise attempting to collect the claimed debt."Without prjeudice" means that the case was not adjudicated and no resoltuion has been made.However, at this point you have grounds for a counter-action if they continue to pursue this claim, or make harmful statements to credit reporting agencies.You can ask an attorney to help with a formal letter to the company advising them that you will take such action.  You should include copies of any derogatory material on any credit reports, and demand that these be corrected.  Separately, you should also notify the credit reporting agencies that the report is incorrect and demand a change.In this manner you protect your intersts - and, if the company is fool enough to try again, you are positioned to sue them in return and make a wad.
Technically IC Systems is liable, but you'd probably have to go to small claims court to make them cough up.  My advice to you is to change your bank account number right away so they can't dip into it any time they like.  (This is the only dependable way to stop unwanted ACH transfers once you have given your permission for the withdrawal.)  Then set up other payment arrangements with them.  While you're doing that, you should tell them you're reducing the amount you owe by the $120 in fees they cost you.  Put that in a letter to them, and pay the account down until there is only $120 left.  Then stop paying.  If they continue to come after you, refer to the letter and point out that you have a legitimate dispute.
Once upon a time, paper checks were a practical, easy way to transfer money from a checking account to another account. However, with today's technology (debit cards), the need for them has disappeared.Direct deposit is paperless removes the need for paper checks for employers to pay their employees.Outside of the workplace, the only people who seem to pay with paper checks are older people, who seem to not have a problem with paper checks and have no reason to adapt, even though it causes an inconvenience to people waiting in line behind them.CMV
We came to this buffet after a show in the casino. The hostesses were not very friendly, but it was busy so we assumed it was because of that. The buffet and restaurant itself is very nice and clean but the food was very average. The food quality was not what I was expecting for the $70+ price tag that we paid as a couple. Next time we are in Vegas we will try another place.
If my wife confided in me than I wouldn't betray her trust. She trusted me to support and help her and I would. I would be extremely angry and maybe even divorce her depending on what type of murder whether it be like a self defence murder or she just thought it would be fun.
Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have from him are his absence, and not knowing what he was like. A lousy father could come in gain your trust, and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. To me having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence because either way he knows nothing about you, and you nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.
I believe that everyone has a right to be happy. I have two best friends who are gay, one is female and the other is male. I have no problem being around them as well as when they are with their partners. I believe that gay people have every right to get married just as I had the right to get married to my husband. EVERYONE has the right to love who they want to love and even if they are gay they should be able to get married just like people who are straight.
Personal pursuit is better in my opinion. How are you going to reach common good if you cant better yourself. People may see that as being selfish but you cant help others if you cant help yourself.
Yes it should be legal. The prisons are overcrowded, and they keep sending people there for possessing drugs. In order to make room for these people, they let other more violent criminals out. Don't seem right to me. And a lot of people learn how to do worse crimes while there. They can regulate it and tax the he11 out of it. Think of all the money the government would collect, not to mention how much they would save from the so called "war on drugs" (which they are losing). Laws would be the same. You need to be 21 to buy it. Driving while intoxicated will still be driving while intoxicated. A previous poster said one drink donk impair you but one joint does. The laws say nothing about how much you consume, but how intoxicated you are. Employers can fire you for being stoned on the job like they can for being drunk on the job.
I'm having a hard time believing you actually got fined for tossing a butt out of your window, unless your area has a risk of forest fire then I could understand.  Your best bet is to take it to court and try to discredit the officer's observation.  Was it raining, foggy, was he parked off on the side of the road behind some foliage?  Were there other cars on the road with you that could have thrown the cigarette out onto the road? The main question you want to ask is "Can he reasonably prove that it was your cigarette?"  If you think that you can win the case then by all means try, that is what makes our legal system so great.  The only problem is that you may lose the trial and then have to pay your fine, plus court fees.
Seek legal advice. I mean if your gonna loose your job anyway and maybe your home for lack of money. What have you got to loose? Your kids could starve you could loose everything you own. Do something before that happens. They company will be heartbroken I'm sure!!!!!!  Most of them couldn't care less about there people, and will try to get you to quit or mess up so they can terminate your employment. Seen it to many times. Just ask a lawyer about you case, they don't have to know you asked them. The lawyer will tell you if you even have a chance. Won't cost to ask!
i dont understand how in the world he took the kids away from their mother...that is something that is extremly hard to do in the courts...but i think that if she wants her family back that bad and feels like if she dont have her family back that theirs no meaning in her life then support her but also remind her to becareful and try to save some money on the side for herself just incase...maybe he really does love her and realized that the grass wasnt greener on the otherside and now he wants his old happy life back....just try and help her secretly save some money as a just incase fund....i wish your sister the best
Suppose our species was wiped off the face of the earth. What better tool could aliens possibly use to gain better insight about mankind? Wikipedia may not be 100% reliable, but it offers a general explanation to almost all of human (and earth's) history. No other resource ever created offers more information about us as a species. In my opinion, this is the single greatest collaboration of information that mankind has collectively put together. Some may argue that the internet as a whole clearly trumps a single source. So for the sake of my argument I would like to keep this discussion limited to one single resource.  CMV
Im Gonna say the Machines, Simply cause it doesent matter which kind of Machine were talking about either terminator or like "i robot" they are not easy to kill. Zombies its 1 shot to the head or taking the head off and its game over. Plus Machines Can Controle other Machines Like cars, supercomputers, Cell phones and a whole citys power sorce and plus military weapons like Jets and tanks etc. and once they get ahold of guns and such were gonna have a HUGE WAR on our Hands
If my wife was to commit murder and told me about it. I wouldnt turn her in because if you really love her then you would have her back through anything good or bad.
Banning bottled water would hurt the economy because it would leave hundreds of people without jobs and the big corporations like Dasani and Nestle would loose millions of dollars. It would hurt the economy severely. Millions of Americans use and purchase water bottle everyday so, banning them would only hurt big corporations.http://www.nestlewaterscorporate.com/bottled_water_things_to_know/
As an ambitious, young person wanting to become a lawful, successful, homicide detective, I would not be lenient with any murderer in my midst.Hopefully, the murder wouldn't be the result of a pleasure/malicious-kill, so that the sentencing won't be as harsh, but nonetheless, all murderers must be tried. After all, hopefully my spouse will understand that having to live in hiding is basically the same as being in prison except much worse since there would be little chance for parole since they will have to live with the guilt and/or the fear of being caught for the rest of their lives.
Purpose of punishment is to reform the the criminals but in some cases         1.   person is beyond the process of reformation and he starts enjoying his criminal acts such as serial killers, psychopath and        2.   in some other grave cases the convict has done such a heinous crime that conscious of a ordinary person is shaken and to deter others from doing similar acts capital punishment is needed.        3.   even law commission in its various reports has recommended not to ban it specially in Indian system.        4.   further such a punishment is given in keeping the norms of the society in mind and in a least cruel manner i.e. by hanging                         so, i feel that capital punishment should not be banned.
Were YOU eligible for unemployment?  If not then you've commited FRAUD.  This can be a felony in most states.  I'd try and get it straightened out before they come after you.  They will notice this and catch on to it.  Today in most states employeers have to report new employees to the state because of child support laws.  This will be a way for them to catch you.  The other main way is with your taxes.  When you file they will notice the W-2s filed in your husbands and/or your name.
You can't say what you want??????Okay, I could understand not being able to criminally threaten someone or attempt to intimidate them, but other than that you should be able to express yourself.Man, I am sorry to hear the UK is going down such an ugly path.As for where to draw the line on rights and liberties, I believe the right to swing my arm stops a few inches from your face.  I believe that you have the right to say what you want UNLESS it endangers someone else---for example no yelling "Fire!" in a crowded theater and no soliciting murder.Laws about what passes your lips can't achieve the real goal of the folks who write the laws: stopping ugly thoughts.
"Be yourself" attitude hurts people who have it, and everybody around them as well. It's an excuse for doing all sorts of stupid shit and not improving yourself. We, as a civilization, have progressed so much by striving for the better, striving for perfection and doing everything to make lives of their descendants as good as possible. People are glorifying all kinds of objectively bad things (morbid obesity, being an asshole to other people, ana/mia, heavy drug addiction) under parole of "that is who I am and you have no right to judge me"
I personally feel that the amount of money they're being paid is too much. Now I'm not trying to be the one to say this from a jealous standpoint because I don't get paid enough from my job. I'm not saying it isn't fair they're paid as much as they are. I'm saying that I think they should be paid a comfortable salary for a nice home and not have to worry about bills and such. But, they shouldn't be paid such gross amounts when that money could be recirculated to help the economy or other critical areas of our nation instead of just hoarding all of it.Yes, this may sound stupid, but I'd really like some insight as to why sports players deserve the amount of money they're given.EDIT: Thank you to /u/081613 and /u/Osric250 for changing my view.
First, let me admit my bias: my USA team's strongest competitor for the #2 Group G spot is Ghana, a head-to-head conquest.That said, sports are played to be won, not to have a lot of points scored, and this is especially true of soccer. I'll give goal difference its due, because it measures the strength of the team over the entire tournament, but goals scored is almost randomly decided, and certainly privileges certain styles of play. It's absurd to me to think that Team A can be passed over for Team B, given identical records and a head-to-head loss, because Team B had an additional goal, with all its attendant factors (only one of which is team strength).EDIT: Let me make myself more clear. The first tiebreaker in group play is goal differential/goal difference. That is right and proper. Then comes goals scored, *then* the head-to-head results between teams. I think the order of the latter two should be reversed.
I am freaking obsessed with this place! Every time my husband and I go there, we wonder why we haven't been back sooner. We tend to forget about it a little bit because it's nothing flashy, but the food never disappoints.  Chicken. On point. Beef. On fleek. Rice, beans, PLANTAINS? God, stop it.So good.  My only disappointment was that I tried dessert and had what I thought was a tres leches cake and it didn't taste like what I thought it would? Maybe I'm used to an over sugarized Amercian version of it :)
A father is someone is always their for you. He's the one that teaches you how to throw a baseball, and comes to all of you baseball games. A father is someone that protects you from all the evils of the world. But if our father is someone that doesn't care about you and spends most of his time in his room, then how can you trust that man to protect you. A lousy father is someone that is someone that you have a hard time trusting. I would rather have no father, then a father that I cant even trust my life with.
I believe that both are bad but I would rather go fatherless. What is the point of having someone in your life that is lousy? A father should set a good example for their children. If the dad is lousy then he is teaching his kids that it is okay to be that way and not do anything with their life. If I got married and my husband was a lousy father, I would tell him he better step up and be the dad I know he can be or get out the house a never come back.
I think it would be better to have a lousy father because atleast you have someone there. Just because a father is lousy doesn't mean you can't change that. Maybe you could knock some sense into him and he would come around and be a good father. The fact that you would never even get a chance to know your father makes me believe that having a lousy father is better than no father.
I would definetly turned her in. No matter what, it is murder. Nobody should commit murder, and plus she might be crazy and kill me, or kill someone else. I would have to live scared in my own house, because of her killing. because if I don't turn her in, someone eventually would find out about it, and I could be arrested too because of not telling. But it would be sad because she's your spouse, and you love her, so I rather preffer her never telling anyone, that makes my life easier.
We've all heard the saying "don't believe everything you see on the internet", which assumes that information gathered from other sources not online have a natural higher level of credibility. They assume that information found in books or news channels or newspaper are more truthful. I disagree. I'm a true neutralist who believes that just because a propagandist had the money to spend to distribute their information through a book or a newspaper article, it doesn't give it any more credibility than typical things we see online. We should obviously look at everything with an open mind and try to figure out what is truth and what isn't, I just don't believe in that idea.Edit: I understand the point of having someone to hold accountable in the case of spreading disinformation. That is a great point. I guess I asked the wrong question though because obviously, statistically, there will be more lies seen online than in publications just because it's easier to spread. Thanks for the posts.
I can easily guarantee that most people who say this have a very weak knowledge or understanding of American history. Moreover, it is impossible to make a judgment, especially such an extravagant one, on a leader who has not even finished their term yet. People fail to look at history objectively and only assess it in the context of their own generation. I'm not a fan of Obama at all, but I can reassure you, we've had at least 5-10 leaders who were much worse than Obama is.
This place is bad. We walk in and no one acknowledges us for over 5 min, but employees stared at us and knew we were there. Finally they told us it would be a 10 min wait. We waited a few min and then they said it was going to be a 15 min wait. There were plenty of seats open too. Very poor people skills, including what looked to be a young lady Mgr.
Really really good! If I'm in the area and in the mood for Korean BBQ, I'll be here. This is one of my favorite Korean BBQ eateries next to Gen and Hwaro. We always get the marinated beef and marinated boneless ribs. Beef brisket is good too and there are a lot of sides! Also the steamed egg is always good when cooled down. I just wish this place has gyoza or other appetizers but in all, I'll keep coming back here. If my friends have extra room in their stomachs, we end up going to Rolled Ice Cream after!
After a year i have yet to be disappointed by the quality of food and the excellent service at The Zen. Since my last review i have tried many different foods and always find them being my favorite compared to anywhere else.Every time i go here i am greeted by courteous employees and they remember me every time. I have had nice conversations with Steven (hope that's correct spelling), begging him to open a store in Peterborough so i can enjoy the food more often. Some of the foods i would recommend are the Chicken Pakora, any of the Pad Thai, Manchurian Chicken Fried Rice and the Goat Curry. There are so many other delicious selections though.If you are looking for something different or just looking for a new spot to eat i highly recommend The Zen.
books is well better than tv because it is cheaper to buy a bookif you wanted to buy a tv it would be really dear and you have to buy a tv licencebooks can help you learna lot of the stuff on tv is either violent or not right for kidsso books are well better
a good proposal for an amendment for the Constitution would be  to change the requirements to be president.  you would still have to be 35 years old and be a resident in the United States for 14 years, but change the natural-born citizen part.  instead of being a natural-born citizen make it be a United States citizen for 40 years.  this way people whose parents move here when they are kids; these would be the only ways that they know and know as much as any other kid here.  i think this would be a grand topic to talk about in your paper and could easly elaberate on with examples.  remember to explain yourself and put your heart and soul into it to get a good grade.
Well, if that someone was under oath and was "giving himself in" I'm sure that they would accommodate the person!Seeing as how you said that there was a Court involved, they would certainly ask the Bailiff to take the person into custody in order that justice may be served.  It would be a time-consuming process of course as are any arrests but I guarantee if you are under oath and admit to a crime (especially murder) then the Court would be obligated to hold that person and begin processing the paperwork.Anybody who would testify in Court to doing a crime who didn't really commit the crime would then be charged with perjury which is punishable by whatever the State laws allow.Someone who truthfully, under oath, admits to a crime would be believed as they swore they would tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth So Help Them God.  So God if your listening, Help Them!!!..................think about it........................
Your odds are not good getting beyond his limits. Your attorney might sue him, but it is doubtful you would be able to collect much. Even if you won a case you would have to go after him for garnishments,etc.. If he doesn't own a paid home or other material goods the attorney probably won't bother. He may look at your personal auto insurance. That will usually cover for uninsured motorists if you carry that coverage but he would have to determine of you could use it since you weren't driving at the time. Since you say you have $170000 in medical bills I am guessing you don't have any personal medical insurance either. Your attorney should be able to tell you what to expect to receive after his fee, which is usually 25% to 40% depending.
No.Any society that values the value of a human life and promotes non-violent solutions would be hypocritical to include floogging and capital punishment in their justice system.With a fallible justice system, there is always the risk that innocent people will be flogged or executed.Where punnishments are decided by mortals, there is a risk that the harsher sentences are handed out according to prejudice.Where the best barristers are available to those with the most money, there is always a risk that the poor are disadvantaged.
My school has a policy where if there is a bomb threat the entire school must pile up in our stadium and wait out until police and a bomb squad come. However a smart terrorist (or whomever) could easily find this out (every school does the same and says it on our website) and plant a bomb in said stadium killing the entire student body and staff. It would make more sense for me to just run to my car (off campus) and escape. Its worth saving my life 100% of the time. Our school tells us whether or not we have a drill that day or not so I would know if its a legitimate threat. CMV.
You can actually see evolution happen. Fruit Flies are quite useful for this experiment since the breed, live, and die so quickly. You have to understand evolution happens because of mutations and they survive because those mutations have made it easier for the creature to survive then the others. ie. natural selection. Speciation is also an example of evolution... different species come about because they have adapted to a slightly different enviroment. If you look you can see evolution
After a spanking I made sure I never did it again to avoid being punished because the second time is always worst because you were told not to already.
does this make sense: you steal a candy bar from school then your parents steal your favorite toy. you stole something and were disciplined by getting something stolen. hm. same thing applies to this. you hit somebody then you get hit. you get told not to hit somebody, then told not to hit, then hit by the saame person
I'm not quite sure I understand the question. Petitions, in and of themselves, are legal. You can make a petition concerning almost anything, and get a bunch of people willing to sign their names to it, via email or otherwise. However, a petition itself is not an actual "legal document"...it is merely a document stating that X number of citizens happen to take a stand on a particular issue and urge a legislator, official, etc. to act in their favor. For example, you can make a petition in favor of banning smoking, but just because you get a bunch of people to sign it, that doesn't mean that smoking will be banned. The petition itself has no legal standing. Now, if a legislator gets enough petitions all saying the same thing, he/she might WANT to do it if it is in his/her best political interest to do so. So the answer to your question is yes.Hope this helped somewhat.
Im a sorry to hear about your tragedy. It sure sounds like your neighbor's son has a serious problem that requires immediate attention. Depending on the mental status of that nine year old, the courts should be able to do something to compensate you for the damage. If he is evaluated by a professional and the results come back normal, you can charge for simple assoult. If not, you can still charge because ultimately, the parents of an ill child are responsable for any intentional damages caused by him. I suggest you speak with the chief of your police station, explain to him what happened and what you want done. If this doesnt help, go a step further up the ladder until you resolve the problem. Bulling has no excuse. Best wishes.
I'll add some arguments here, but please don't feel obligated to address them point by point. There's plenty of stuff I've probably missed/gotten1. With the advent of Constantly Variable transmissions that shift gears more efficiently than humans, stick shifts - even well driven ones - no longer have the potential to give better fuel economy. 2. The chance of a manual stalling on a busy road is a very real threat to public safety.3. The frequency of replacing a broken clutch is higher than repairing automatic gearboxes, negating the cheaper cost of manual cars over the long term.4. They are a liability trying to start on uphill roads. 5. They are generally far noisier in urban areas due to the average driver's reluctance to shift up gears on short streets or journeys. 6. They divert the driver's attention away from the road as they focus on selecting the optimal gear. 7. I cannot eat a cheeseburger while driving. Please CMV.
I am generally against the use of the death penalty on moral reasons for practically every reason other than crimes against humanity, as I think killing another person is an issue that concerns humanity in general. I don't think it has moral use for other heinous crimes such as murder or rape in practically every circumstance. I can see why people here have the opposite opinion and so I'm willing to change my mind. I'm hoping to hear something new though, and not just an argument saying how bad some examples are.Edit: My moral reasons rest in the fact that killing a person is against humanity. Therefore capital punishment should be used for something that goes against humanity itself.
The difference between "pro-life" and "pro-choice" comes down to whether or not one believes a woman should have the option (choice) to terminate her pregnancy. By believing that this choice should be legal, one isn't advocating abortions (as in, they aren't pushing abortions on people or thinking that they're a good act). One can hold the position that abortions are morally bad, yet still believe the choice should be between a woman and her doctor. Likewise, one can be anti-choice yet still advocate for the death penalty, wars of aggression, etc.CMV!
Opera is great. It has all the best features of the browsers, but it has the least recognition. Take "Speed dial" for example. It puts your 9 most used bookmarks in the screen when you create a blank tab. It also has many add ons, but it's community is just beginning. Also, it was recentlly rated very highly in CPU magazine, with its only flaw being it's lack of add ons, which is greatly increasing. Opera will be releasing a new version of the browser; 9.52, which will have many enhancements, including speedier performance than any of it's competitors. In fact, Opera is so good that until recently, people were willing to pay for it.
Education should be free because it is one of the key ways to decrease poverty. If education was forced to have fees the people in poverty would not by able to afford it. This would cripple the poor and put us in a society where only the middle class and rich prosper. (it's bad enough as it is). The people in poverty will never learn how to prevent diseases which plague their society, nor other resources to help them live better lives. As a society we should want to help those who are less fortunate.
Very cool topic.Yeah I think it could reasonably happen. I mean just look at the reactions around the world to incidents in one country and the ripple effect it has.When Tianamen Square happened there was a reaction all over the world. There were not mass riots but there were really strong opinions in every major country and lots of news reports.The world is too open now to try to hide incidents like these.I can really see how it might happen.
I think it is better to be fatherless because a lousy father cannot do anything for the family.Imagine a father who is alcoholic and beats your mother, then you have no meaning of having a father.He creates violance and terror in the house and you alawys feel ashame to call him a father. It is better to be fatherless than to have a father who gives you a hard time.
Some kids don't learn by spanking them..So why waste your time on that, when you can always take something valuable away from them.
I would turn him in becasue it is wrong for any reason to kill someone. If he can kill one person what says that he will not kill me? Everyone wants to know what happened to their loved ones and that would give them the peace that the person that did it was paying for what he did. Love is not worth the risk of you getting caught for not telling what you know.
In this situation it depends whether you knew the victim or if it was a stranger. If my husband killed a random stranger, then YES I would definitely turn him in because that considers him a psycho and what if he kills me too. But if he killed a person that I knew and that was harming us then I would think about it. It's most likely that I would turn him in just because I would be afraid to leave with a person like that, and also what if he thinks I will say something and kills me too.
The person above is absolutely wrong.  Property is property.  He will own it as long as he is able to pay taxes and the mortgage.  His business will remain his business as long as he can run it. He and only he will decide if he wants to sell his house or his business, the government can't take it away just because he is here illegally.But he could get in trouble with the IRS if he doesn't pay taxes, but that has nothing to do with his immigration status whatsoever.  It is not true that a person here illegally cannot pay property and business taxes.  The IRS has the same authority over any citizen or non-citizen that does not pay all the business taxes.  So tell him not to worry about the government, just make enough money to pay the bills.
It's not the reaction times -- it's the crime itself you're punished for.Driving while intoxicated is a special case because there are special laws regulating alcholol and other intoxicant. But while it's easy to test for drug/alcohol use in an objective blood test, it's almost impossible to test for emotional or situational impairments.So, driving while intoxicated can be punished by itself, separately, because there can be objective standards. But anything else can only be punished based on the objective results.
I booked flights with Malaysia Airlines from Dublin to Hong Kong (via Heathrow and Kuala Lumpur) around 2 hours before the MH17 crash. Yesterday I received an email from the airline, offering a full refund up until 24th July, or offering to change bookings to a later date. I now have doubts about the safety record of the airline, even though it appears that there was nothing that could have been done to prevent the latest tragedy. The fate of flight MH370 remains unsolved, and declining consumer confidence appears to be reflected in the Malaysian stock market, which has experienced overall growth of 80% in the past five years while Malaysian Airlines stock price has fallen by the same figure. In light of this, I'm seriously considering taking them up on their offer of a refund. CMV
I would say before.......I have never been married but have been with someone long enough to be commonlaw so I will consider it the same thing.As far as sex comes it was much better earlier in relationships before marriage/long term commitment.It seems when your new all your hormones are racing and you feel the excitement of being with someone new/ different. After a long time having sex with the same person the quanity and quality both began to subside.It seems after a long time it seems like a routine with less experimentation same positions, same girl, same everything....I find the excitement of having sex with someone much better, constantly being turned on not being able to keep your hands off eachother.
Last second find...Not what expected in a grand way! Who knew?? Sushi was on point delicious and fresh for our group of 10. Service was spot on. Proximity to the action of Vegas inside & out. Worth a stop in for dinner and a show for sure. Gotta pay to play my friends and this joint is worth your dime. Cheers
Another reason for wearing a school uniform is good is that the uniform will always be decent. It will cover every part of the body that the school doesnt want the children to show and the students would not be cauntious about what they are wearing.
No. I would not turn my spouse in. I would try to convince him to do the right thing and turn his own self in. But i dont see it as my place to go and turn him in. but it also depends on the reason behind him killing someone. it just cant be some random killing because i would turn him in for that for the fact that i would think that i would be next to get killed.
Love is much greater then any mistake. I know things happen but my wife will be able to confide in me no matter what goes wrong. I made a commitment to stay whit her through rough times and I will. Murder is a unforgivable mistake but love is not.
I would not turn him in unless he killed a more than one because there is no way it could be an accident more than once. I think if i loved the person enough i could hide the facts and act like it never happened.
People who are against tv keep on saying that it causes obesity.I'm not going to go for a run and bring a book to read on the way. I think it is much easier to exercise watching tv then reading a book.In gyms people do not have books infront of them, instead they have telvisions.Studies have shown that telivision is even more stimulating than books.
Parents should use spanking as an option to discipline only when it's needed. If the child doesn't follow the correct behavior that they should follow after several times being warned, then that is when the child deserves a spanking.
I support this because... I got spanked and I turned out to be a good daughter ..spanking teaches you not to do it again and be scared of doing it again.
I just don't think its worth it to spend a lifetime of hardship and fear in the real world, constantly wondering when would all come to an end.I'd rather have a normal life inside the simulation, and of course it could be a terrible and rough lfe, but it could also be a happy life, something that would be very difficult to achieve in the real world.In the end, we are nothing but souls connected to a life support system (the body). If my soul can achieve happiness through artificial stimulus to my brain rather than "real" experiencess, so be it.
I believe businesses shouldn't (but not to the extent of enforcing it by law*) give discounts to senior citizens and armed forces.Forgive me for saying, but does reaching the arbitrary number of 65 and serving a tougher by nature job entitle you to get a discount at the movies and at a restaurant?  Is it just as a way to say thanks?Armed forces seem to already get thanks with tax free goods on base.Senior citizens these days that are retiring are already reaping the benefits of social security, medicare, and hefty retirement funds because the benefits of being in the Baby Boomer generation.There are many tough professions out there that bring lots of value to the table that are tough but don't get discounts.  What about farmers?  They feed us right?  Doctors?  They keep us healthy.  Scientists?  Their discoveries and innovations improve the quality of our every day lives.
A long while ago Putin ordered all his government officials to close offshore accounts. He ordered all government officials to buy Russian made cars. And wealthy Russians use other countries to skate around Russian taxes. Now the US and EU are sanctioning business and people (I try to keep up on all the sanctions but I lose track). Europe buys from Russia much needed gas, and in turn, Russia buys things from Europe. They have a nice little ecosystem. So I believe, not only will this hurt Europe more so in the long run, but help Russia. Because Putin may use this to reign in his corrupt officials and tax skating billionaires. Don't rely on overseas business and don't use tax havens, because they will get sanctioned or frozen. This is just my opinion, or view. I'd like to hear others. Thanks.
I always hear about how if only we as a society would ignore WBC they'd go away and dissolve. I don't believe this. They are going to be in our history books because, despite what people want, they have gained enough attention to be placed so. I'm in no way saying I agree with them. But one thing that's good about their existence is extremism. I believe we as a culture, nation, even the world, should study more on extremism. It pushes people to do the craziest shit and we seem to get blindsided all the time by extremists. Why not analyze what these people believe and learn what makes them tick so we can learn from them? They believe in their minds they're right and we as a society are wrong. If we study the extremes, we can take better care of ourselves and watch out for the people who seem to win over nations, races, and society and cause them to do horrific things. So, change my view.
I think the recent feminist push (particularly #yesallwomen) in reaction to the shootings is taking away from the central point of despite Elliot Rodger being sexist, if mental health were a bigger issue and looked at more closely then the shooting potentially would not have happened. I'm all for feminism, do recognize that women face daily challenges men don't, and that there is a definitive misogyny in our culture, but taking a shooting that happened because of someone's mental health and spinning it for your own cause is unneeded and hurtful to the original problem. CMV.Edit: For clarification I don't think this is *soley* a mental health issue, or that sexism didn't play a part in what happened.Edit2: Thanks for the great discussion guys. It's very easy to feel "attacked" when you post threads like this but I haven't felt that way at all; I'd like to commend everyone on their ability to talk about differing view points and opinions instead of just arguing.
No I wouldn't tell on him because you never know what the reason might be for him to kill that person or it could have been for self defense for all we know and if the people come question me about anything I DON'T KNOW NOTHING.....he have my trust and I wouldn't let him down for no reason plus his secret is safe with me...
Even though Raffles sacked Farquhar when he came back to Singapore, this was because Farquhar was adopting measures that were not approved by Raffles. I believe Farquhar was adopting measures that were indirectly harmful to the population and Raffles sacked him for the best interests of Singapore's population at heart
Farquhar won the affection and respect from the people with his doings. When he was sacked, thousands of people bade him farewell on the day he left Singapore. This proves that Farquhar is very important to the people.
A lousy father would be able to teach you more than no one at all. Maybe he will be able to teach what not to be like, how not to act, how not to treat your family. That is better than no teaching at all I think. He could toughen you up. Also you will at least know who he was and never wonder if your father was a saint or lousy, you already know.
Yes because that way the child can learn not to do it again because it really hurt, and i know this from experience.
I would say yes to some circumstances I would say yes but for others it would be a no I will not turn them in. I feel that if my spouse killed a person out of self defense or out of defense for another person then no I wouldn't turn them in. Another circumstance would be if they killed a person for killing someone or something like I that, then no I wouldn't turn them in. If they killed cold heartedly like rape, for money, objects and or just a pure disliking or a person then yes I would turn them in because someone that's that cold could kill me.
I think it's really two different questions, the letter of the law and the spirit of the law. Overwhelmingly Brown v. Board was successful in beginning the intergration of the whole of America, not just in education system, overturning the previous SCOTUS decision of "equal but seperate". However when you look at the spirit of the law, I believe it is still lacking, mostly due to geographic and monetary limitations. The disproportion in schools in wealthy, mostly suburban neighborhoods, to the poor mostly urban neighborhoods, is a problem we have yet to deal with. One could easily make an arguement that the system is now not seperate but still unequal due to the ability of communities to fund their local schools, not due to any prejudice.
Tell them exactly what you posted here. They should excuse or re-schedule you. I was summoned while away at college, and was waived/excused twice because of that (since I was not living in town at the time). If you're studying in college, they will excuse you, so you don't miss any education. You shouldn't have a problem with it.
I don't think you can make a statistical argument for the existence of aliens when you only have one example of a planet with life.If you had two examples in the Milky Way galaxy, for example, we could conclude that life probably evolves at least twice per galaxy. Or if we had an example from the nearest star with planets, we could conclude that probably every star with planets evolves life.But with just a single example, how do you possibly use that to estimate the distribution of life in the universe?  It could be once per universe, once per galaxy or once per 100 stars.  It would look the same.e: my point is not that life does not exist anywhere else.  My point is basically that I don't think you can estimate the probability at all.
A shotgun would need to be loaded and fired. A chainsaw is continuously running. Assuming the zombie population on this block is densely packed, I would pick the chainsaw.I'd go down the block while spinning in circle: a spinning circle of undead carnage.(Although if there is only a few zombies, the shotgun has the advantage of distance.)
No because spanking might effects the relationship between the child and parents. And Children can pick up on the parents attitude acting violent. There are better ways to solve problems, for example using the other techniques.
Blackmail is where you offer NOT to reveal some embarassing or damaging piece of information for money or some act:obtaining or procuring something by illegal means, such as by force or coercion.Here there is neither force or coercion.I don't think this is blackmail exactly, because there is no force or coercion. However, one might argue that by offering the information for money, it could be.I would call the police and see what they say. Since the girl didn't do anything illegal (I assume?), it's not something the police would care about, but the threat is real.
No one should be treated like less than any other person based on the "accident of birth" such as their sex or race, or as the ryhme goes: "All men are created equal, what makes the difference is in the sequel". In otherwords what you choose to do with your life determines what you are worth, not teh color of your skin, your accent, sex, or age. If you can meet the criteria for a job you should not be judged by factors you were born with. No one has a right to discriminate against you or target you for scapegoating. Every person matters, man or woman, physically fit or handicapped, whether of European, African, Asian or Native American, etc. ancestry, and everyone gets a vote in how their society, community and nation is.
Most people, most of the time, rather than form an unbiased opinion (if such a thing even exists) about a certain issue, actually form their position due to emotional reasons - a gut feeling, if you will.(Edit: Please disregard my title; it is too general, whereas the last sentence presents my claim more precisely.)This is most evident when, for example, two people with differing views discuss politics. Each person will justify their opinion on ostensibly rational grounds. However, most political discussions end with both parties saying what amounts to "Your arguments are less convincing than mine." There is some "meta" reason causing the person to be more open to certain arguments than others, and that meta reason, which is the *actual* reason for the person's opinion, is not rational.
Neither one of these 2 Italian crooners were depsite their sucess realy gifted singers IMOBetween the 2, Dino had the better voice, more range and better tambre, Dino's early inspirations, his model singers when he was a aspiring singer were more blues and jazz basedFrancis had better phrasing and had a knack for using space anf timing far better than Martion. Frank also had better material especially from the mid-50s on when he had the extraordinary Sammy Cahn and Jimmy van Huesen writing most of his songs. Jazz musicians and fans enjoy Sinatra much more than Martin even though neither are jazz singers, The Chairman of the Board did have some jazz sensibilities and his songs have been recorded extensively by jazz musicians yet rarely have any of Dino's songs have.
We are just people at the end of the day and if knowone likes same sex relationships its there problem. I think that Gay and lesiban couples are not hurting anyone so whats the big problem. They should be happy and not live a lie! you can argue and say that god made a man and a women but i dont think that god would want you to be unhappy thats the main thing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Just really not a good experience here. The place was not too busy and everything was just so slow.  The staff was overworked I guess. The food when I came out 1 hour later, was not very good.  Don't order the mushroom stroganoff.  It was inedible. The sauce was just milk and the mushrooms to tough to chew. We had a group of 12 of us in the patio and it was really not fun.
Books enlighten the soul. Books don't destroy the morals of children. Books throw the mind into a series of questions, they take the readers to mystical places, paradise, and even the kitchen sink. They change your perspective on life and often give the reader a sense of relativity. Television is like a drug. It's as bad as nicotine. Fahrenheit 451, the Night Circus, The Secret Garden, Inkheart... Do I have to further explain..?
I am a nurse and the more I studied biology, the more I was in awe of the miracle of our bodies. Every tiny cell has it's own design that is even more complex than a computer. When you look at a computer do you question that there had to be a creator? Or do you need proof that this highly organized machine came to be about by a mere accident or order of circumstances? Evolutionists need more faith than Creationists.
The government has no place to tell a woman what she can do with her own body, ever.The government DOES have that right.1) a woman cannot legally prostitute herself in many states2) a woman cannot take illicit drugs into her own body3) a woman cannot use her body to murder others4) a woman cannot use her body to steal5) a woman cannot display her naked body in publicthere are many others. Men can also not do these things.The government tells us what to do with our bodies ALL THE TIME. This is no different.
I am Pro-Life,Here is a question for anyone who is Pro-Choice: Is the baby in the mother's stomach living and if not how do you know?
I feel that its totally against everything that is American. How about everyone straps a GPS system to their legs so the government knows where everyone is, oops that's right cell phones i almost forgot. Besides this the government is saying its all in public safety, but i dont kno how safe i feel if i know someone is listening to my phone calls. Give me a break if i wanted to blow some shit up I wouldn't talk on the phone to make plans for it anyway.
In one sense you bring up an interesting point.  Let me challenge you with a broader concept......do our Laws reflect our Morality....or does Morality stem from the Laws we make each other abide by?In their written series of civilization, Will and Ariel Durant made the point in the first book, "Our Oriental Heritage", that man did not need or make laws until he thought his neighbor needed them.Think on that a bit as you ponder your own question.In my own personal opinion, I do believe that faith can and should inform public policy.  In a republic such as ours, we have agreed to abide by the majority, until a new majority comes into being.  And each new majority will bring its' own set of values.
First of all, very first of all, us people are very greedy. We like to scrimp if we can, so we can pocket the difference. $8B, according to Forbes is its budget. If it was so useless, or even if Congress felt they could get away without it, they would immediately remove it. $8B more! They'd raise their pay! But they don't. Why wouldn't they? Because they think it serves some sort of purpose, and I am assuming it is the one of protecting the USA. Secondly, it is evolving. You have seen new security measures every year and while yes, they are annoying, they may have potentially saved your life. How's that for throwing away 500ml of water and standing in queue for 30min?I can see that many people in reddit disagree with this, however, and I want to know why, so I can form a balanced opinion. So CMV!
Just a note to the creationists. Please use the "Convinced me" link correctly.You're supposed to click this if the person's argument convinced you that Creationism is true. Some of you seem to be clicking anything and everything on the right hand side.This will not help you win the debate by the way.
Whoever said porn degrades women is idiotic. #1 They get compensated well, #2 they CHOSE to do it, #3 some girls actually like what they do, #4 without sex and porn, you may not have been born. Sex = life. =)
This debate has clarified for me that the government shouldn't really be in the marriage business.  Let the churches perform marriages for whomever they think fit, and let the government simply record the marraiges or civil unions and grant equal rights to them all.  As for plural "marriages,"  they exist, but there is not a sizable part of the population which supports them.  That is a different debate for another day, and the issues are quite different.  In my mind, the purpose of marriage or civil union is to provide support to individuals, especially when they are raising children.  Some of the most monogamous couples I know are gay, and they are some of the best parents too.
I had the oppertunity to visit Dar just a couple of weeks back.  And to answer each of your questions separately may be difficult for me.  But maybe my observations while I was in Dar may help you find some answers to your questions.First and foremost, what I felt is that there is general feeling of detachment in the general public.  There is hardly any enthusiasm in whatever they are doing and have a tendency to just follow, whatever they are told.  There is great amount od tired, laid back approach to work and things can take forever to acomplish.I am sure Tz as a country has lot of potential, but if you ask me my opinion as an outsider if Tz can develop into an exemplary country, my response would Yes, but there is long way to go and a lot to change before that.
I often ask myself the same question. The sheep stand behind him because this administration has done a successful job in terrorizing his (Bush's) supporters with fear. They use the crayola chart to let people know the 'terror threat' yet they want people to live their lives and not let what happened on 9/11 to affect how we live. The crayola chart really is only needed by state and local governments as it advises if they need more resources for that particular time frame. (public servants)In the name of ' I don't like that party ', people will side with him as well. So Bush could have told people that he is the spawn of Satan and people would have still voted for him becuase they so much dislike the opposing political party.
HAHAHA! It's not going to happen.People are free to make there own decisions in life. Yeah, maybe it sucks that there is such big consequences to it, but really you sound stupid! Sex should not be taught as an evil thing. It's not evil or dirty.  Maybe you should teach your kids about responsiblity and learn to talk to them about it. Jails are over crowded now. Imagine what it would be like if ppl are thrown into jail because of that. You can't stop nobody from doing what they want to do. You should know that already from when you where younger. The more you discouage it the more they are going to want to do it. People have that right. Yes, even kids. That's the only way they learn.
Well I think ultimately its just going to be a gimmick, why would the large supermarkets want to pay more for coffee beans etc when they don't have the decency to pay farmers in this country a fair price for their goods, and when we are all brainwashed on the money making "carbon footprint" idea how do you justify flying food round the world just to help the poor.I don't think that the social elite will go without fair trade or organic even though its riddled with GM, due to snobbery.
Anything intelligence created by a more intelligent being is artificial correct? The creating being is the "real" being, while it's creation is an imitation of itself. That means if anything we create is artificial, we ourselves are artificial intelligence.....if we were created. If we have rights and need to respect one another, does that mean we should have love and compassion for our creations? Would it be possible to love something we have given artificial intelligence? If not, how can god love me or you?
"Nothing exists." To utter that sentence - or even contemplate it - applies existence to something that is "nothing." Yet to argue that nothing exists asserts - paradoxically - that in fact, no thing exists. It is a logical impossibility to argue that nothing does not exist. Therefore, we must apply existence to nothing - making nothing something indeed!
That's your best argument - "Because they don't" ?I thought there was a reason for everything...I don't see the squirrel outside my window evolving. In fact, I'm pretty sure squirrels have looked and acted the same for thousands of years.How does an animal aquire a trait that he wasn't born with? Does he just wish for it really hard and it magically grows?And you proved my point - "species have certain characteristics and properties"I noticed you didn't mention that their characteristics randomly changeAnd by the way, I'm just wondering because I'm a curious person...what insects are you talking about?
Yes! and yes and yes and definately a god damn bloody yes.Lack of physical education is the reason why your aunt or uncle is in hospital.Lack of physical education is the reason why millions of people are fat.Lack of physical education is the reason why you cannot sleep properly at times.Lack of physical education is the reason why you are not having super great sex with your girlfriend(s)
this is my big problem with christianity: why is it about belief. there have been horrible people who are believers. what about wonderful people who do great things for the world and are atheists. is it fair to punish them for not knowing what the nature od reality is??? I AM an atheist and im a good person. the idea that a mere belief difference can seal ones fate is beyond preposterous, its madness!!
Gay Marriage. I'm an agnostic so in no way does my religion conflict with this matter. I'm an avid gay rights supporter. Marriage, is said to be the marriage of 2 people who love and care about each other. Some Straight couples just get married for the benefit of getting kids. So is that right in any case? What is the purpose of marriage if 2 people only get married to reap its benefits? I.e Have kids? As we are living in a developing society, more and more and more people are coming to terms and agreeing that gay marriage is ok.
First of all, the Constitution does NOT guarantee the "pursuit (or persuit) of happiness".  That expression appears in the preamble to the Declaration of Independence.  On substance, I doubt very much time and energy is spent in enforcing laws relating to prostitution in relation to other offenses. Finally, will you admit to any role for morality in criminal law?  I mean, take laws relating to age of consent -- why is consensual sex illegal for, say, 15 year olds but not 16 year olds?  In other words, how do you draw a line?
Doc, be very careful with this. I'm a writer and an ex police officer. These people will have you surgically removing their boots from your own...Send an official certified letter to the actual original publisher of the material along with a permission form to use their content. And, if they don't get back to you, extract the info from another source. Protect yourself my friend. Their lawyers will eat your lunch and not even leave you a Twinkie! Also, a disclaimer on your site is still a good idea. Tina
Instruments have such wild limitations compared To a normal composition programs that I think they're obsolete in the modern musical world. They have imperfection, and you cant control the frequencies of the sounds you're making as well. People will spend years learning how to make a single sound, instead of all possible sounds. When you play an instrument, you're just a drone, an atomaton playing someone else's piece. It's like being a soldier vs being the president. Sure, it takes a lot of work, but it's a waste of talent.
This is influenced by the IAmA submission from the guy who proudly kills fellow human beings in the name of "saving" wildlife. But really? How are poachers more morally and ecologically irresponsible than hunters? Hunters have been responsible for the extinction of wildlife in recent memory and in past events of human existence. Hunters, just like poachers, threaten animal for the sake of profit. Anti pouching initiative is hypocrisy in itself. One, it does not make the existence of mankind better. Two, it doesn't stop the extinction of various species in wildlife at the hands of human beings.
Was very disappointed with this place.  Been going to a ramen place down the street for a while and always leave full and happy.... came here after hearing all the hype about pho and wasnt happy.  i totally would pick ramen over pho any day!!!!the egg rolls were very good and that was the only good thing about the dinner!
Anyone who says Firefox 2 has major memory leaks obviously hasn't actually used Firefox 2. The only memory issues I've come across is on opening multiple windows (20 or more at once) or when leaving Firefox active for three hours or more at a time (A known issue, which a simple restart will fix).And arguing for IE7 in favor of Firefox... Weakness. For every feature they added to IE 7 they removed one of the advantages earlier versions had. (Flexible toolbars? Customizable buttons? Who needs em!)
Have any of you noticed that those who are against books are the ones who have terrible arguments. Like that person who just said TV is awesome with many exclamation marks and in capitals. That clearly proves that books are much better than TV because it TV rots the brain.
The scientific rigor you mention is not present in evolutionary theory. Here's one example: In the 1800s, Charles Lyell and others came up with dates for the rock strata. Radiometric dating wasn't invented until the 1900s. When it was invented, the techniques were calibrated to match the dates Lyell came up with. To say that this proves the dates that Lyell came up with is a logical fallacy, and it sure doesn't sound like true scientific rigor to me.
I wouldn't live my life right if I never got to meet my father. I wouldn't care if I grew up and had lousy father even if he has no job or life and maybe even an alcohlic. Having a father means alot especially if your boy because most fathers are friends to, so you can talk to them about guy problems and they would understand the situation and with just living with your mother you couldn't because she's a woman and her views are different then a guy. Whether its a good or lousy father they will always be there for you at sometime in life.
god aint flipppin real, so get over it u dumb belivers of god
I believe that spanking you child because it shows then that what they did was wrong and if they dont want the feeling of a but woppen then they wont make the same mistake twice.
It wasn't just the jews, hun.  The nazis weren't acting out of hate, like Stalin.  They were doing what they deemed right.  "The Path to Hell Is Paved with Good Intentions".  They wanted a master race, and sorry to say, but jews, and miscellaneous others did not fit that category.They did whatever they could to accomplish the master race.  They weren't exactly hating the people.  They were just using the same cruelty we use when we experiment on animals, or give them horribly adverse living conditions.  We view ourselves better, and them as inferior and having no feelings, and no right to live happily.  That's what the nazis did to various people groups.Stalin just treated anyone badly that he could treat badly, and enforced a "Harvest of Despair".  You should watch the documentary below:
Answer is NO! However, I think the bigger problem is finding out who leaks this information, there are a lot of Clinton era hold-overs.Newspapers are in the business of bashing Bush, so they will do whatever it takes to hinder the war effort, and then hide behind freedom of the press. It is getting people killed, and prolonging the war by telling our enemy everything they need to know.
It's boring. Kind of scary. I am not going to complain about the regular sex.shower time could get right out of hand.seriously it is a drag. Psychiatric wards can be scarier, but you don't necessarily have to sleep with guys if you are broke and need a smoke, lot's of good looking loonies(I can say that I own that word) in the hospital and you cannot catch crazy so it is worth going for it.So each has it's pros and con's but I would have to recommend psyche ward over jail. and jail over my last marriage.oh for the people that say you lose your self respect, speak for yourselfs. i am just dandy.
The schools are teaching kids learned helplessness.  It only causes the true victims of the school to suffer at the hands of administration.  The current "Stop Bullying" campaign is propaganda to keep kids from recognizing themselves as autonomous beings and is a key reason why there are more school shootings.  When you back an animal into a corner, it will strike with full force.  That is what the school system and laws in place do.  I also believe the laws in place are turning kids into people who can't solve problems on their own.
no the world will not end NASA keeps looking and we won't get hit for i thimk it was 3,000 yearsthe funny thing is made a bet with my friend if the world doesn't end in 2012 i get $5 if it does he gets $5 he said "if we see the asteroidsi have to pay up" i can't wait for those $5 LOLThe Master Chief
Oh lol. People to point this out believing in God is called "faith" and we don't need proof to deal with this atheist's. The idea of God is false is your own words, and I don't have to deal with this , whatever you think is your faith so we won't stop you. Both side contradicts each others belief and no one truthfully wins. This is probably a fight between two armies where both doesn't win until the end. Mainly , I support Christianity because of my "faith to God" and your proof that God doesn't exist doesn't change the case or turn it the other way around.
It must not be mandatory, but at least a requirements but not more often. How would you consider PE if the child is not so well? And if possible separate boys from girls, for boys assign some good games of physical education activity to them, same thing with girls, give them games for girls ideas.
Gay marriage bans, along with other laws, are only in place because of the religious right that seems to be infecting this country. The UNITED States of America can only remain united if laws are created with all men and women in mind. To have a law that favors one religion, or lack thereof, over another is the bane of freedom. Secular law is the only law that works.Leviticus 20:13: "If a man lies with mankind as he does with womankind, they are both commiting an abomination, they shall be put to death, their blood is on their own hands."There's a loving god, eh?
The deal is: "Freedom of speech goes both ways"People not only have a right to say pretty much what they want, other people have a right to object, argue & even ask for an apology. A liberal says something, a conservative objects & the conservative is bashed for 'violating a person's freedom of speech.' A conservative says something, a liberal objects, and conservatives either let it drop there or defend the original statement on its merit.So who is really against freedom of speech;The conservative who asks a liberal for an apology for an offensive statement, or the liberal who acts like you aren't allowed to express the fact your offended by a statement?
Capital punishment is simply the best law enforcement out there. Ask any country that has employed it. You'll find that their crime rates are MUCH lower than the USA's. This only applies if the nation is comfortable with it of course. On the other hand, its immoral for a man to take another's life no matter what the situation since you are assuming a position of superiority when you do so and every man on the earth is equal. Despite its effectiveness, there are multiple other alternatives to it and capital punishment should not be a first choice.Its simply a matter of perspective in the end.The typical christian perspective goes against capital punishment and thats due to this christian country. The simple truth is that its effective but at the same time, from a biased perspective, its barbaric, immoral, and there are better, though not as effective, solutions.
To answer your question and to refute the genius who compared captial punishment to abortion:The fact is, yes, there have been far too many instances where people have been put to death then later found innocent.  Our judicial system needs to put policies in place that will prevent this from EVER happening.  But generally, if a person, without a doubt, has been convicted of a malicious crime, they should be put to death.  How sane is it to allow someone who raped, tortured and killed a young girl to sit in a jail cell and live off taxpayer money?  If that individual feels someone INNOCENT deserves to die, why should they be allowed to live?  Again, I believe there should be WITHOUT a doubt concrete evidence against a person who is put on death row.And concerning abortion...unborn babies have not committed heinous crimes.
It has been proven to the satisfaction of many people, but there are some that are extremely hard to convince, for a variety of reasons. These reasons are mainly faith based, in that they have faith in the government, and do not want to believe that their government could murder three thousand of its own citizens. They will all wake up in due time, probably when the country is under Martial law, with curfews imposed, and they become prisoners in their own house.That's for the lucky ones of course. The less lucky will become prisoners in the 600 or so concentration camps which have been built around the country, and are already manned and waiting for their presence.
I like very much the way you started: ALL RISE!And there is no legal system which is perfect!Moreover, though, I do not trust "god" and this is due to the fact that god never talks to anyone, except the leaders (which gives me suspicions that the leaders claim they were told by god! - what do you think?)For example, whenever someone attacks another, in the last 16 centuries, they claim that god ordered them to do that! Last, but not without importance was the Bush claim for America's and her allies to Iraq!
last time i checked he still has the right to a court appt attorney..until then if you can"t make bail or get a bondsmen then i guess he will have to tough it till his court date.....if he hates it that bad..then maybe he won't make the same mistake again when choosing a girl. We all have our lessons to learn, some get the rough end for seemingly no reason sometimes..but this is life and you can't always come to their rescue.....even when sometimes you feel you need to...grown up problems come with grown up consequences that are sometimes hard to fix. Sorry
In my opinion Nascar is not a sport and should not be considered one. First of all it's about as entertaining as watching cars drive on the highway. I don't know how anybody who can stand to sit in a stadium for several hours in the sun watching cars drive really fast in circles. How the hell is that entertaining. I'd rather watch a cricket game! The drivers don't even have to be in shape. As long as they don't have high blood pressure their bodies can endure. So why does anyone like such a pathetic hobby?
I would be in favor of that. My personal convictions could never allow me to support caging an animal up behind bars for the amusement of people. Animals are meant to be free. Of course nothing like this would ever be taken seriously by a substantial amount of people because for the most part animals are viewed as inferior which then justifies locking them up. F**k zoos.
In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus, and I think we all know that a lot of men consider lesbians to be downright sexy, because there is no man in the picture to ruin the aesthetic. (Vice versa for gay men.)Additionally, gay women are more "socially acceptable," for one of the traditional reasons behind homophobia: women are inferior to men.Gay men are discriminated against because they have no honor: romantic interest in men is for women only, and when an man participates he is "lowering himself" to a women's level.Gay women, on the other hand, are discriminated against less because romantic interest in women is a man's attribute, giving them honor.(The preceding is not my opinion, but instead my rather cynical interpretation of modern society)
India is in my personal list of countries to keep an eye on over the next thirty years. I think they're a good contender for superpower status before the end of this century.
Even if there was a valid proof for the existence of god, there would be no valid proof that that god is Christian or not.
I have lots of gay friends. I'm all for it!People should stop being so against it. People can't help it. I've watched shows about it and I can really see how gay people feel.. when people are looking at them and some of them feel like they are being watched. It is just not right. We are all human.
Thats just liberal ignorance. A criminal will find a way, be it a gun, knife, baseball bat...It's just "feel good" legislation. Makes the liberals think they are doing something to combat crime (while letting the criminals run rampant)Statistics show that criminals do less when up against a well-armed citizen. (And crime rates drop). And for the record, the second amendment is there, not to protect our hunting rights, but to allow us to have the ability to fight back against a governement that goes out of control. And hunting rifles against machine guns isn't an even matchup.
Grrrrr....EDIT: Don't bash Clinton! He eliminated the deficit, and we had a surplus for a short time. All the while we survived and the economy was good. Bush blew it. He saddled us with that deficit. what's it up to? Eight TRILLION plus? Who's paying for the Iraq war? Who's paying to rebuild the place? Where is the Iraqi oil money? They are selling oil. Where do you think that money is going? Hmmm....
We've got a bunch of Good Ole' Boys up there scratching each others' backs, making a living off of us and turning it into a career. Need to enact term limits of no longer than two terms in both House and Senate. Get those 80-yr old geysers outa there. They've already earned their lifetime pension and benefits.Good people go to D.C. with good intentions, but they can't do anything by themselves. So in order to get their Bills passed, they have to help pass someone else's Bill that is established there and knows how the system works; the Good Ole' Boy System, that is. The Good Ole' Boys are just biding their time, keeping their system going and blocking everything else. They work for themselves. All incumbents -- OUT!
I'm not the one who created this topic by the way. But people free to their whims and desires are malicious, myopic, primitive, subject to vices, cannot be trusted, and must be kept in line, to a certain extent. It doesn't matter how good those Randite arguments sound good in THEORY, 100% pure capitalism won't work. Note that I am not advocating socialism, just controlled capitalism.
i think black ppl give more of a bad name!...only bcuz more then half of all jails are black ppl and u barely c white people on tv when anything bad happins! u mostly see rappers who r black go to jail for some stupid stuff and u nevr c any country singers that r white go anywhere bad!..im not sayin white ppl arent bad to cuz there are things that go on with them to but its all mostly black ppl!!...i think all monkeys and krackers shouldcreated equaly....but seperatly!
Unless you want security to manhandle your fiancé don't go here.  I don't care if Tiesto or Calvin Harris is playing here it is a joke. Security should protect their guests, not make it more difficult and/or hurt them.  My fiancé had a bruise on her arm and soar for a few days.  Way to have a 300lb security guard push a shove/grab a 120lb woman in heals, hope your ego is soaring.  And btw we hadn't had a drink yet.
We have been to Carpe Diem a few times before their move to Elizabeth.  We tried it again tonight for our anniversary dinner.  Big Mistake. While granted, it was a Monday night (I get that in the restaurant industry), the food was pretty much awful.  Over-seasoned...overdone. Steak overcooked; Quail undecipherable in it's bed of black (white) rice and syrupy sweet sauce.  Wine overpriced. Salad uninteresting and dressing was boring.  Appetizer meatballs....well, regular meatballs without pasta. The descriptions were nice but the food didn't live up to it.  They had our table decorated (for our anniversary) but didn't offer a glass of wine, an appetizer , nor a dessert for our special occasion.  Expensive and um..."let's just go home and have a glass of wine." kind of night.
HOMOSEXUALITY IS WRONG!!!! And I like this website but I don't find it very clear. This one is better : theworlddebating.com
Well "The Champ" It is not the Woman's body we are talking about, it is a new life. And if you are going to be irresponsible dont let a new life die for it!
a number of reasons..because the girls are out looking for a good time with guys in perhapes the wrong places--ie the bar or disco or late night partiesbecause guys are  "lacing" drinks with drugs quite easily because the media portrays "a good time" for young people  as" having sex"and uncool to go without it because girls dont think their safety is their priority anymore and if parents try to warn them they react by going all out with guys giving them the opportunity they are looking forbecause the "safety antena" of girls arent as sensitive as they should be to keep them from becoming a victimthus date rape is a consequence of all these factors. so girls need to take care, be aware of your own safety dont give "strange" guys the upperhand if you dont want to be date raped..
The conversation can not be used as evidence in a court of law.  I don't know what the lady hoped to gain from recording the conversation other than to create more drama.  Some people are hooked on drama and they actually do what they can to create it.  Run as far away and as fast as you can from these types.  They will suck you dry.
NO.Whoever made the first 'response' is a prime example of how powerful propaganda is.I don't ever remember hearing of a VALID case that had anything to do with the use of marijuana and someone being violent, much less some killing spree. Regardless of what the government provides as services for those who are ill, it shouldn't have the right to totally ban the use of certain substances. ESPECIALLY when those substances are LESS harmful than the ones that are legal!Wake up guys! NEWSFLASH: You can die by drinking too much water! Just because you'll get help from a hospital or whatever doesn't mean they should ban water.Where is your logic guys?Also to those who whine about it being a gateway drug:If it wasn't illegal, it wouldn't be a gateway drug.It's made bad only by the hypocritical efforts of the government and the gullible people that trust their efforts.
Even when the sentence was ridiculous to begin with?  Non-violent drug offenders, who need rehab, not warehousing with real criminals, have often been given longer sentences than violent criminals.  I spent years working to get a woman paroled from a 20 year sentence for possessing 2/3rds of a gram.  And even though she betrayed me when she got out, and caused me deep hurt, I still do not believe it was fair that she was in as long as she was.
I think that could be a contributing factor. Plus, our media doesn’t show all the true horrors of war: refugees, dead soldiers, grieving families, etc. And the thousands of other grotesque nuances that cannot be translated well into media form, like the mental anguish, etc.So, having a war on our own land could give Americans a taste of their own medicine. It’s easy to grow complacent when it isn’t your children being blown to pieces, your town left in ruins or your legs being blown off.That why I cannot comprehend why people verbally attack people like Cindy Sheehan. How can you question her motives if you are not in her shoes? Only a coward would attack a parent of a brave soldier that died believing he was protecting his family and country.
I enjoyed his briefing today. It is clear that he understands that he is taking hits by being compared to Bush's Katrina as far as this oil spill goes and understands the Sestak issue will have to be dealt with, whereas before, I don't think he or anyone else took it very seriously. What bothers me is that he took 77,000 from BP, yet directs the corruption between politics and oil companies being the problem. However, that cozy relationship was established long before he got into office. This problem has existed since before Carter was in office, so for him to keep pointing fingers at Bush is irresponsible.
Let me start by defining what Wrestling should be:Wrestling is the act of physical engagement between two UNHARMED persons, in which each wrestler strives to get an advantage over or control over the other.Are we seeing this on television? No!The definition above clearly contradicts what is happening on television today. Many persons can testify of seeing men and women using chairs, bats etc as weapons which means that they are harmed!The violent approach of some of the wrestlers are terrible, i can remember clearly the ' UNDERTAKER' putting a rope around his opponent's neck while the steel cage was going up and it hung him. What a terrible sight!.....
Matthew 5:18:"For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled." Unless Im missing something Heaven, and Earth are still in existance, and not all the prophetic events listed in the Scriptures have happend. I open with these words from the Messiah Yahushua himself, and take him at his word as he is no liar. I realize my post is not in a question format, but this is my opening statement in support of my vote/view on the question posed...The Torah/Law is forever!
All we can say is a big IF because we are not yet 100% sure if this nation itself could lead the whole world. Who knows maybe in the future that India could fail to lead us. There are still other countries who are more progressive, more literated, more powerful than India, like the USA, United Kingdom, Russia, Japan, etc. This nation doesn't have yet enought potentials and ability to sustain the needs of the people. India is not yet that full of technologies like in the Americas. Well in fact technology is one of the most sophisticated and essential inventions ever created.
This not only degrades morality, it also affects how women are treated in society today. This is against women empowerment in a sense that women are viewed merely as sex toys. Which at the end of the day affects how men perceive women which will in turn lead to a lot of disrespect and false perception.Now, how about crime rates? Murders, Rape, and Sexual Abuse. According to studies, all these people who committed these grave crimes all had one thing in common: PORN.
jarman:porn is wrong because it sholud be in 4-D with surround sound and special effects :) it would make it much more pleasurable btw im a girl........
What - is God coming in the year 2100 to judge us then? Not in 2000?Why would God have to tweak anyhow. The guy is all-powerful. So he created some single-celled organisms billions of years ago, and then said to himself "I'm going to set this thing called evolution going and see what happens. Yes, I'll tweak these tiny organisms a bit. Then maybe humans will evolve some day and I can make Mary give birth to Jesus."Yes, that all makes a lot of sense. A good use of God's time.
Good idea for separate student from other people for at least increase garment job. Why we use soldier uniform? For separate from civil. Why terrorist not use soldier uniform? For harmonious with civil and easy to attack enemy.
It's better to have a lousy father for practical reasons. You can blame every mistake you've made on your father. He won't pry into your business and search your room and take your stuff because he doesnt think I need it. He wouldnt care so much that he would get pissed and throw my backpack with my computer in it at a wall putting a hole in it because I didn't clean the sink after breakfast or I forgot my keys. I think it's actually an opinion because that kind of father is still lousy because he'll tell you that he hates you and I ruined his life.
Same sex marrage can couse a lot of contriverse, it puts peoples life at risk in extrem cases gay marrage has caused so much trouble pepole has resulted in murder and sucied
i remember the only country by whose fear alexander's army was afraidit was INDIAafter just sixty years of independence INDIA is looked as the country to become the sixth member of security council of UNand it is also the country with a great development rateAnd i know that none of us are unknown to the great contribution of INDIA in the discovery of god particalthen from where the matter comes from that INDIA is not having the pottential
Lets see Hitler committed suicide in a bunker in Germany in 1945 which makes him DEAD.President Bush is alive and well in the year 2006Unless one of them can time travel its impossible for them to be the same a********.  I understand about the different s**t part.I may never get to level 4 by answering all these types of questions but its starting to get less boring see ya
that depends.. I lost a friend a year ago to drugs.. very sad...Drug use in general is psychological thing... there are studies that suggest people who use drugs are self medicating for some other diagnosable mental illness....for example.. many alcoholics are found to have symptoms of anxiety and panic disorders... this is a good example of peer pressure.. nobody wants to hear about a grown man acting like a sissy?. society says.. "hell no.. lets go out and drink.."the problem with drug use is.. you are covering one problem with another.. therapists will have to spend many years dealing with the drug problem before they can even begin to address what caused the compuslion to use drugs...so yes. i believe in treatment.. i believe you should help yourself... however.. one can only get treated if they are willing to accept help.. for repeat offenders .. i offer no sympathy..
not really cause u didn't fill out an accident report and your work will argue u did it at home and u have not proof that u did it on the job that is why even a minor cut should be reported to your supervisor or u have no case did u tell anyone that your back was hurting before u left work and if u did they have to sign an affidavit that u did hurt yourself on the job and put their job in jeopardy and risk losing their job too so if u do hire a lawyer u better be ready to fight a long and powerful battle and nine times outta ten u lose so its best to goto the chiropractor keep your job and mark this up as a lesson the next time tell someone a couple hundred dollars is worth more losing your job and possibly getting black balled from gettin another cause when u fill out an app i don't care what anybody says your ex employer can black ball u and tell them what happened and u won't get the job
I think black people have their rights protected. The state gives them the same rights as others. And don't give me examples. It won't change my view. I am aware that probably their education rates are lower and their poverty rates are higher, but it doesn't matter. That's probably affected by the discrimination that happened in the past or it's just their fault for not being successfully integrated into society. As I said I don't want to see statistic about poverty, education levels, criminal levels, how many of them are living in ghettos or what % of them are in the higher positons of the state hierarchy. I want facts about how are they actually discriminated.PS. Sorry for grammar
Violence is perpetuated and caused by society.Advertising reminds us of all the things we do not have and makes us feel inferior for not having them.The news makes us distrust each other. Our distrust of each other causes us to treat each other not as people but as things to interact with.We have people screaming at salesmen- why? Because we don't see them as the same as us. What makes a telemarketer so evil but the high pressure of modern living forcing them to not let you off the phone.We kill because we feel upset with our own lives, we are frustrated because we are sent images of friends that we'll never have, products we can't afford, and movies full of lives we'll never live.It's not video games, it's televison programming and society that cause this. There are fewer suicides in small farming communities than in large cities, and less murders, because people are more close knit and friendly to each other.
I think it is bad to wear school uniform because it makes you look unatrel and you cannot express yourself enough so band school uniform OK
well, India is finding difficult to manage itself first...so there's no question of leading the world so far....but still if we compare so lets have a look at the following points:1. almost 90% of India is illiterate(don't be sure of the percentage), so an illiterate country can't lead the world....2.India is more into castes, politics, religions and less into development.3.the most important thing is that India doesn't have confidence on itself and is still cursing itself...So if it goes on so then it is difficult or even impossible to say that "INDIA WILL LEAD THE WORLD WHEN IT CANNOT LEAD ITSELF!!"
That doesn't make much sense. Why are we still evolving and the monkeys aren't?Why aren't fish jumping out of the water and growing legs?I mean, if it happened billions of years ago than how come its not happening today?Why can't we find psuedo-hybrid fish with legs forming?What caused evolution to stop happening for a mysterious time of thousands of years?
Some people say God is against porn. But we won't know that because the bible does not mench porn because it did not exist during biblical times. So how do we know it is a sin?
Means you don't have to worry about what you hve to wear!Less awkward when people say wear school uniform and you wear mufti...
I like tv because you can watch all the porn you want with your family
You have all missed the point.Confidential sources within the Government that leak classified information  are not covered by the freedom of the press.When a court order is issued, there is more at stake than a news story.  Often the court order compromises one case to resolve another.When you have someone that leaks vital information that threatens the welfare of the American People (nuclear secrets, etc), you might give up a case against a squealer to get the name of the mole.Freedom of the press means you can publish what you want.  It doesn't mean that you are free of the consequences.Geraldo got thrown out of Iraq for airing the American battle plans for Bagdad before the battle.He shoulda been hung.
When considering any changes to the structures of any of their professional leagues, a lot of arguments revolve around how parity can best be maintained or enhanced.I don't see why anybody cares.The most exciting moments and periods in sports happen when there's a handful of titans ducking it out, not a mediocre field where anybody can win.Sure, Barcelona/Real Madrid/Atletico Madrid are miles ahead of most of their competition in La Liga. But tons of people who otherwise would never watch a match will tune in when they face each other.People don't tune in to watch games between two middle-of-the-pack teams nearly as much as they do for games between the top two teams in probably any sport.True parity, if achieved, would mean that every team is a middle-of-the-pack team.Why should I prefer that than having a handful of teams that are truly great and exciting to watch?
Based on an assumption that humans are artificial and not part of nature, then if we could create another being capable of being a sentient life form, it would not be equal to us no matter how more intelligent, until it has achieved the same things as us, including creating more sentient lifeforms. If it does achieve those things, then it would have to do so at same rate, otherwise if it was faster it would be greater than us, or if slower than still inferior to us. However this would only be the case of course if we as "artificial beings" of God our creator, would be capable of creating another sentient being in the same image and likeness of our creator and not just ourselves. Otherwise it would never be our equal.
Trapper was a pretender, a goofball who got out while the gettin' was good. While he was back in the States starting his private practice (Trapper John, MD), BJ was with Hawkeye until the end. As the war dragged on, and Hawk was starting to lose it, did Trapper call to see how they were? No, but BJ was delighting his comrades with home films of Peg and Erin, pranking Charles, and taking over surgery while Hawkeye was seeing chickens on buses.
I think the worst problem can be when debaters spend a significant portion of their time debating about trivial things...such as misspellings. We all do it on occasion...don't we? I could bicker about the member who posted the debate on being illiterate...and rant on about how ridiculous it is to make such a remark...after all, how could posters be illiterate, if they read and write? The person who created the debate obviously doesn't get that...even if it is just an attempt at being sarcastic...but what's the point?
If god loves everyone then y does he hate gays and the bible is just a book, have you ever wondered that the one cardinal who translated it changed some things to make "god" look good
The minimum length for an argument is 50 characters. The purpose of this restriction is to cut down on the amount of dumb jokes, so we can keep the quality of debate and discourse as high as possible.
well, you see people these days are to busy to see what is going on in the world.  I may not know everything, but from I think people are just to stupid to just watch what Bushy (please do not sue me because i just said "Bushy" instead of Bush,I just like the name like that)here is doing. You see, also people are sometimes to poor to buy their own TV set or even a newspaper(or they're just to lazy too) because of taxes,gas prices,and ALL OF THEIR LITTLE STUPID FRIEND!!!!!!!!And there is my opinion, you may not like what I just wrote, but DEAL WITH IT!
Recently, I saw a meme about protesters in London pouring concrete over so called "anti-homeless" spikes. All of the comments were commending and praising the protesters instead of calling them out on property destruction. More often than not, the goal of a business is to make money, it is not a charity. And seeing homeless people near the entrance is enough to turn a lot of people off that would normally enter their business. So in my opinion, Tesco is just acting in rational self-interest and these protesters are nothing more than common thugs whom should be charged with property destruction and have to pay the costs that they incurred. I see nothing wrong with the spikes if they are doing it to protect their customer base.
If you have read some of the other reviews you'll see that service is an issue.  Our group of 3 encountered the same experience at lunch on a weekday.  The staff were all young.  I did not see anyone who appeared to be older than 22 years of age.  Perhaps they need someone older with some customer experience??The food was great.  The bok choy was outstanding.  Just about all of the dishes show on the menu with a little chili pepper symbols.  However, we did not find them to be all that spicy. The 3 stars is for the service.  5 stars would be for the food.We'll return here but allow a little more time to pay the tab since they are slow at cashing out.  So, if you have a certain time available to you for lunch you may not want to dine here.
sabrejimmy,I have not tried to prove ANYTHING. All i asked was for YOU to prove that we are not evolving.Not once did i say that we are still evolving.I have not made any such assertions.So until you can show that we are not evolving with credible evidence, you are just avoiding something you cannot answer.So i say again, back up YOUR claim that we are not evolving.And the big bang is a red herring, we are talking about evolution, NOT Cosmology.It looks like you are trying to steer the debate away from what it is because you cannot back up your claims.
The real issue is - why is the government involved in this issue at all? We take a personal, religious institution and regulate it, then the government comes back and wants to redefine it.It should not be a political issue, because my personal, religious things should be separate from government regulation.Marriage and the government should not mix. That solves the "problem".
Gay marriage is wrong. God made man and a woman to populate the earth. How can human species survive if they are only attracted to their same sex? Obviously, not.
I'm an avid christian and I believe that gay marriage is wrong beyond belief. This country was founded on christian beliefs, and we should adhere to the belifs used to make us what we are today.
aah...u r saying like that only india has this things.....other countries donot have this.....does the america which seems as leading the world doesnt have bad qualities.....it eats less and waste more.....the amount of food they waste can be utillised for feeding whole indian population...it produces more pollution and blame us...what about it !!!!!!!
Statistics prove that less than 1% of women who are raped get pregnant because of the adrenalin rush. We have no right to take an unborn child's life. There are ways to avoid the situation of abortion. The woman can have the baby and give it up for adoption or raise it as their own because the woman is the still the child's biological mother. There are thousands of people on the waiting list for another baby to add to their family. DO NOT let anyone tell you otherwise because they obviously havn't been in the situation of adoption or abortion.
please it is president Clinton, and though people are going to say it is just politics it is the same issue. if it is wrong now it was wrong then.  if anything there has always been a double standard between Democrats and Republicans.  people are screaming about an illegal war can not remember president Clinton asking congress for any wars he got us in. but you have president Bush who did go to congress.
If the judge couldn't hear her clearly then I think he has every right to ask for the person in question to remove her veil.  If the woman who is a lawyer could not be understood in court then she is not doing her job properly due to the presence of her veil and the judge could not do his job properly either.  I can only respect for asking for the veil to be removed, I mean it isn't for very long and she was fighting for someone in court!  We're in Britain here where the covering your face is seen as suspicious, these women relly need to think about the message the veil puts across about them and their religion.
Why not?  People complain it is against God.  so those who feel that way should decline wedding invitations from gays.  MAN makes these rules and uses God as an excuse.  There are religions where a man can have many wives; do you  hear anyone complaining?  Anyway marriage does not have to be a religious ceremony.  People get married every day by a Justice of the Peace, a Mayor, even a ship's captain.  atheists get married.  what's the big deal?   so all the people who think this is a sin, would leave the "sinners" alone,  after all isn't it their God's job to judge them?  and to "punish".  They do believe their God gave them "free will" don't they?
I work in downtown LA and the homeless problem here is pretty bad. There was a guy who threw his shits in front of our building this morning. At the food court I go to, homeless guys sometimes walk around and beg for change. They're also begging and sleeping on the LA subways because our subways don't have turnstiles and rely on the honor system. They are a nuisance to everyone. Most of them look like they have mental illness. I think for any major city to develop faster, it needs to get rid of the homeless problem. I think homeless should be rounded up, put into camps, and treated for their mental health or addiction problems. That way major downtown area could be cleaner and safer and the homeless could get the treatment they need. The approach that most cities have of ignoring the problem won't work and it really hurts the local economy.
I understand the democratic party collects the most money from PACs. I understand as a union guy that our dues are paltry, and the teamsters and other unions supply a comparatively tiny amount of money to politicians as opposed to corporations. There is already so much undue influence by corporations that I think the ability to fund pro-union politicians would be a fine democratic check to the power of capital. When a politician wants to use legislation to curtail my right to assemble and air my grievances it reminds me of state socialist countries that do the same to their autonomous worker organizations.
In comparison to civil dress, school uniforms prove to be futile and wasteful once the child is out of school.
India does not have the potential to lead the world because the country is full of corruption, corruption in politicians ,numerous religion, fight between various religions, and a lot more............................
Whether you are in a venture purely for yourself or others, you still end up affecting the people around you.When asking someone why they decide to help with the common good, the response would be something along the lines of, "it feels good to help out."Ultimately, people don't help out people unless they get some sort of satisfaction out of it, be it whether they community service hours, material rewards, fame, or just having the satisfaction of knowing that you have importance. So when helping out others, you make others feel good as well as yourself.
there isnt an excuse in the world to kill a fetus, a baby, a child, anyone.if the woman was raped, it most certainly is Not the baby's fault. the woman with the baby whoever they are should speak For the baby, and know that the baby would want to live.
Because it would be thoroughly unfair to force people to pay for things they can't afford.Get real.  "Allow" connotes freedom, which is all a government should give you.  And that same "allow" is what permits anyone to make whatever they want out of themselves, purchase whatever they want.  You'd have a gripe if you could phrase the question "How can the US FORBID people from buying food or health insurance," but you can't.
Christianity conflicts with historical, archaeological, astronomical, biological, and many other forms of evidence. It denies rational & impartial common sense. Its teachings, written by an all powerful, all knowing, creator of the universe, are filled with contradictions. The arguments for Christianity just don't hold ground (bar one or two, and those are close). Atheism is not perfect, but it is the more logical position of the two.
It seems that what bothers you most is the inconsistency of laws.  We have laws that are supposedly in place (like the seatbelt law) to protect ourselves from harming ourselves -- yet we have not legislated all forms of self-harm.  What I find most annoying is the artificiality of saying we pass these laws to "save lives."  I believe the reality is that we pass these laws to save other taxpayers for picking up the cost of a person's health care if they've chosen self harming behavior.  (Examples:  seat belts, motorcycle helmets, recreational drug use.)  If we were just honest, and said these things are illegal because we as a society don't want to have to bear the costs associated with medically caring for those injured as a result of less "safe" behavior, I think most of us would find such laws much less distasteful.
in response to another person's answer, if cigarettes were made illegal, it would save countless peoples' health and lives. it would save hospitals thousands of patients with cigarette-induced cancer. i dont think that is a loss of money. it would only save lives and money.besides, cigarette industry deserves to crash. i would love to see that day. all those sleaseballs selling death deserve to be jobless. not teachers and medics and firefighters.those of you who support cigarette legality are losers.
Yes, in North Carolina, there is a three day waiting period to purchase a hand gun. This is after you have taken the time from work to take a state mandated fire arms safety course, go to your county's sheriff's office and fill out the necessary paperwork for a criminal background check and FBI search and fill out an application for hand gun purchase. In the mean time, you could have bought as many of what ever you want off a street corner in one day and be done with it. The criminals have it made in this country...why do they make honest people go through so much to get a hand gun? I know other states are even harder to deal with....New York being one of the toughest! They're trying to make honest people not want to even have guns.Why isn't there a national standard on the gun law? Should individual states be able to create their own laws concerning something straight out of the Constitution?
Not only this but anything 'intrinsic' to that person is more to do with an environment which is outside of their control than something they choose or even genetics."Give me a child until theyre 7 and i will give you the man"The world is one big chaotic system. Literally EVERY SINGLE choice you make, even subcobscious ones come together to create your destiny so the choices you do make as an adult are a product of how the world treats you as a child and the seemingly meaningless mundane choices we make decide through butterfly effect more than the ones that seem meaningful anyway.
Cats, definitely. They are independent. You don't have to take them everywhere you go and have to watch them and make sure they eat and use the facilities because they can't on their own.Cats are amazing animals and pets. They aren't always happy like dogs are, almost to the point where they are too stupid to know the difference."Cats make you work for their affection, they don't sell-out like dogs do" Jack Burns from Meet the Parents!With cats, there is no cleaning up the yard, having to walk a dog and cleaning up their sh$t, no loud-ass barks in the middle of the night, no slobbering all over the place, no puppies pissing all over the floor, etc.Cats are adorable creatures.Dogs are...well....:sigh; dogs!
You are asked before anything is installed for the browser.In IE random toolbars appear from nowhere
Just because you think your opponent has been brainwashed one way or the other does not make your argument any stronger
I dont want to say i officially have a position, but i want someone on the other side to answer this because i honestly just dont know:if a 14 year old is raped (which, we have established, happens), and she then gets pregnant, but because she is 14, she will die if she has the baby, what is the pro life decision? is it then pro-life to have an abortion?i just dont know and i want an answer from someone on the other side
Why not both? Why can't God have created a way for evolution to happen.Who says that God did it himself?Who says that God didn't cause the Big Bang or evolution to occur?FINAL ANSWER: EVOLUTION THROUGH CREATION
The child is young and doesn't know what is wrong and what is right.
let me start by saying i feel marriage as an institution is ridiculous and needn't exist, however thats another debate entirely. To me who wishes to get married is wholly irrelevant. Hell i think animals should be allowed to join in holy matrimony as well, it would certainley be an entertaining ceremony. Far more so then any wedding i have ever attended.
white males are slowly becoming the minority.sorry, but, no; i don't think there will be laws protecting white men.i don't think there should be ANY law like that. if you can do the job and do it well i don't think it should matter if you are white, brown, black, yellow, or red, male or female.just do the danged job and get paid.
Absolutely not. It's the first step down a slippery slope to a total government nanny state. Obviously you are better off wearing your seatbelt. You are better off not drinking or smoking, exercising 5 times a week, eating a balanced diet, chewing 15 times before swallowing your food, looking both ways before crossing the street, and not running with scissors.Thank God we haven't reached a point in this country where EVERYTHING that you SHOULD do you MUST under penalty of law. This is a free country, right?
I disagree because, well I started my life with nothing, grew up in the projects, and have now created a small fortune.  I owe no one!  I will walk on anyone who tries to take from me, what I have worked for!Me and my brother were the only white kids in the projects...  Talk about unfair!Take your cry for reparations to someone else...  I simply don't buy it!
Hope that didn't come out as too crazy sounding or confusing. But basically I was talking with my parents who are both vehemently religious and I made a realization that while religion does contribute to wars, the biggest problem that religion is that it prevents the spread of advancement in science, specifically in the fields of medicine, climate, and biology (with issues in climate change and evolution), and society, specifically with same-sex marriage, abortion, contraception, marijuana, et cetera.
