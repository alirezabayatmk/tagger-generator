The [app0] in bottled water production has [app2] water extraction in areas near bottling plants, leading to water shortages that [app6] nearby consumers and farmers. In [app8] the millions of gallons of water used in the plastic-making process, two gallons of water are wasted in the purification process [app16] gallon that goes into the bottles.
*For the international CMVs the term greek refers to a social component of my university that throws open [app6] every weekend. Each party has a theme/dress code.*A lot of people may say that to a certain extent everything is alright in fun and humor, but I believe that organizing parties with dress codes that allow people to dress up as racial stereotypes should be frowned upon and ultimately banned.By allowing these [app20] to go on as a college community, we are furthering the segregation, discrimination, and undermining of our international cultures as they are portrayed as a "joke" to those who attend in attire.Ultimately, by forbidding the use of these themes (in favor of more non racially specific [app20] themes such as black light or tropical) we are protecting the integrity of our international and ethnical students, while very little harm is done on the greek end.
So, if you are on a beer run with friends [app3] of them forgets their I.D. but they are not purchasing, requiring them to show I.D. is both a useless and inconvenient policy. I can understand why they would have it, but even [app14] basic rational thought it doesn't make sense.There's nothing stopping the person buying the [app19] from walking out of the store, and walking right back in alone, to a different register or going to the next store over to do the same thing or ultimately, preventing any real [app20] on the part of wal-mart. If someone who is 21+ buys for a minor, the law will attack them, not the selling institution. All this does is discourage people from buying alcoholic [app20] at the store in the first place.CMV.
It is 6:53 PM and I wanted a juice. The [app3] behind the counter proceeded to tell me that they have already sanitized the juice machine for the night. Pulp does not close until 9 PM. What a horrible experience and terrible customer service. Pulp does not close for over two hours. Really?I have been coming here for about a month and during that time the wheatgrass shot machine has been down. I figured OK it is a small shop how long could it take but a month later (according to a Nother customer it's been almost 2 months) and still no wheatgrass. Now this. I will not be returning.
So I have been here before but now as Yama sushi has become so popular and big the sushi has 2x more [app7] than before and less fish, also [app9] has dropped to something impermissible, on too of the fact that they recently got a B- Health Inspection rating for 16 violations most of them being the fish not being kept at proper temperatures. Go somewhere else, or just make sure you get good service.
firefox is much better.It remembers passwords with greater gusto.add-ons allow you to personalize your browser in every way. I love - tabs (aging and remembering them when you close the browser, weatherfox, gestures,there [app11] a tab that lets you display the [app14] in IE format if something is incompatible (rare, only SAP at work)and the way you can put the link logos in the tool bar rocks.much friendlier and a better browser, and not just because i don't want to support MS. Because i don't care about that, a good product is a good product.
I fell like advancing the common goods is better [app3] most people will look [app5] themselves rather than look [app7] others. Looking out for yourself before lookin [app10] others won't do alot of [app13] run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also [app20] to you helping you better yourself.
Children have two role models; mom and dad. Parents [app3] their child's behavior and personality so if that relationship is [app6] then the child's character can be damaged as well. I would [app10] be fatherless because the damage of a lousy father would [app14] my personality far greater [app16] fatherless.
The internet is still such a recent phenomenon, that laws and policies are being created as we speak.But unless you're pretty certain they'll be OK with it, you should ask someone if you can put a link to their website on your blog. That would be the right thing to do from an ethical standpoint as well.A lot of people create 'banners' [app20] people to put on their websites as a link to their's. But some people don't mind if you put the URL.Bottom line is, when in doubt check it out. I can't answer your question about the legal ramifications (see link, below). But my bet is that you could end up getting into some hot water with someone if they haven't given you [app20] prior to your adding the link. Why risk it? It's just a matter of asking.
Not if it happened outside the workplace and after working hours. As far as I know, sexual harrassment only occurs when the person receiving the comment, approach, or inappropriate personal contact perceives it as insulting, demeaning, or threatening. Many people bend the sexual harrassment rules in the workplace by [app16] remarks from their co-workers. I think that [app20] against sexual harrassment exist only for the workplace environment (whichever this environment may be). But I believe that a person can get [app20] with the cops if he or she is accused of bothering another person in a sexual way.
Misinformed voting is a problem, and I think that introducing a way to cut down on the amount of misinformed votes is important. The test that would be implemented would not be very difficult, [app11] ensure that the voter had read [app14] before they vote. I believe something like this could be accomplished by trials in which sample populations who [app20] yet read [app20] would be allotted a certain amount of time to read the bill, and then answer a variety of multiple choice questions. From this information, researchers could pick and choose questions that those with a poor high school education could answer having read the bill. -EDIT-I would like to also say that this would be an 'open book' test; [app20] would literally be in front of them.
I was reading the post today about the supposed Malaria vaccine when it occurred to me that while it's terrific that this discovery [app7] the suffering of infected people and eradicate the potential to put more through that sickness, it will ultimately result in an increase in world population. Every new development in sickness prevention or life elongation contributes to the steady and inevitable increase in people on this earth. The bottom line is that people will [app20] die at a smaller rate while new people are increasingly born at a greater rate. The earth cannot sustain this. Is there another point of view that would help me enjoy these medical discoveries more? All I see is a bleak future fast approaching as more people live longer.
I believe the current situation in North Korea is no laughing matter yet when scrolling through comments on reddit, whenever there is a mention of North Korea, it is almost certain that a joke about it will follow. The jokes mask the reality of the situation and although a small [app16] the people commenting may actually believe in what they're saying, to most, the living conditions, mass executions, labor camps, and the [app20] of nuclear technology in North Korea is something we should be aware of and possibly take action [app20] the situation.I understand people have a right to joke about whatever they want, after all, they are just jokes. But to me, I find them just as insensitive and inappropriate as joking about the holocaust, other genocides, and injustices to human rights.And yes... I do expect the top comment to be a joke about being banned from /r/pyongyang
Sometimes a girl just wants some Matzoh Ball soup and this place is one of my faves... I will say it has been inconsistent from time to time (sometimes being less flavorful than others but that is not always the case--- I have been satisfied more times than not. Sandwich [app16] is good, veggie burger is one of the better ones I have tried, and they are generous with their portions. We often use Wheel Deliver to get the Smallman Street Deli and everything is always marked [app20] and the orders never have issues (unlike many places who do large lunches unfortunately). I will keep patronizing this yummy place...
I think it is usually acceptable to break the law if, [app3] breaking it, [app5] suffer bodily harm or death. Also, if the law is fundamentally designed to discriminate, I think that at the very least some people need to break it in order to be able to argue against it in the Supreme Court, for example when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat.
Watching documentaries and reading books about the Seattle scene, it is common to hear references to how good some other bands were and how Nirvana were not that special. I think the Melvins said they were a bunch of bums who [app13] the jackpot. Well I have gone back and listened to a lot of bands mudhoney, Green River, Sonic youth and others and i'm sorry to say I never heard anything close to a 'Lithium' or a 'Smells like teen spirit' .Those songs are magical and have beautiful, haunting and unforgettable melodies and really good pop hooks. There were other great bands that are in the same league like Pearl jam and to a lesser extent Alice in Chains and Soundgarden..but no I dont buy the Spiel that Nirvana were 'just another band'.
The realism in games such as call of duty and [app3] mirror that of the cop and soldier training simulators [app6] teach people knee jerk methods on shooting others.Observing depictions of human death and suffering has become the past time for millions of kids around the world. To think that the mind is not being trained to [app19] violent through media seems illogical to me. In ww2 there was a serious problem with soldiers not shooting there guns and not having the will power to, so the militarily started introducing the man shaped silhouette to pop up so the soldiers could learn based on stimulus response to shoot a human figure. Kids are being taught that they can gain points or a high score through human death and suffering.Change muh view
Even [app0] is true that Raffles did [app2] closely with the population to develop Singapore, he provided plans, ideas and was going to put them in action by himself when his superiors ordered him to Bencoolen. Hence it was common sense for Raffles to leave his subordinate to finish his ideas
I volunteer at Irving Cares, and when I do I feel so great that I can help the community. To me when I help [app8] common good I am helping myself. When people do something for the good of others it helps them out in [app15] run. Whether it is a favor in return or anything else. In a personal pursuit you are just helping yourself. If we [app20] helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me.
Bush assumes it will put US at risk of loosing the edge in industrial production.The agreement will put stricter restrictions on emissions from various industries in america.To adhere to the standards america needs to upgrade a large number of industries.Another reason is these agreements will be fully implemented in usa but the other third world countries does not have the financial power or expertise [app20] it. So the third world countries will be polluting and [app20] cheap [app20] while US will be investing [app20] technologies and creating expensive products.But in [app20] run US will reap the benefits if it signs the environmental agreement, as we have only one earth.
Cannot believe didnot write a review for this placeLocated inside the Planet Hollywood and its open 24/7.Great [app5] go to when you have the munchies while yourRecommendations-Full Montagu..Beef and turkey..Its a very tasty sandwich .-Holiday Turkey..Wow it taste like a turkey plate with stuffing, turkey and cranberry. Very good if you like turkey.-Original...Just Ok..Its [app18] sandwich and it was nothing special.Usually stick to either Full Montagu or Holiday Turkey.All sandwiches are under $7 so what a deal!!!They also have salads and soups.Line moves pretty quickly so donot [app20] long line scare you away...
is it wrong? yes. unhealthy? yes. Addictive? yes. but [app3] smoking ciggarettes. just because its wrong doesn't mean it shouldn't exist.
I think that personal pursuit is better because i think that [app3] before others is natural. I think that no matter what you do everything comes back [app9] if your helping others, because you dont want your life to be out of whack helping others.
Men have been hit hardest by the recession, and [app3] bounced back well. Lots of men [app5] unemployed, and men are going to college at lower numbers than ever.Meanwhile, women are being given incentives to go into colleges and fields that men are not.There exist lots of secure jobs (teaching and nursing are the most readily available and accessible examples) that are 90% female, both in the [app20] in college majors. Considering the higher male unemployment, I think anyone offering a female-specific incentive such as a STEM scholarship should be required to promote a male-specific scholarship to a female-dominated field.Please CMV.
Just look at our own bodies, we have residues of our ancestors, we shiver and get bimps like reptiles, our hair stands on its end when frightned and we all have tail bones, I am not an atheist, I believe in God, I just believe that God set things up with the creation of the universe knowing what would happen including [app20] was created woul evolve and turn into life and that life would continue to evolve, it's all part of the Master's plan-I have no conflict between believing in God and evolution and neither do a growing number of progressive believers of God of various denominations
I [app0] the argument that people are basically good. That is not to say that all people are good all of the time, or even that all people are basically good. Clearly we have had some rotten eggs. But that does not mean we are essentially evil, selfish things. Easily misled, perhaps, but not inherently bad. On an individual level, people are capable of great caring and impressive acts of selflessness.
I believe that the wearing of the school uniform should be encouraged because it reminds each child that they are equal (at [app7] school). It also shows unity and children feel [app10] and it helps them to work as a team.
It is [app0] have a lousy father than to be [app3] you will have someone [app5] learn mistakes from and to give you [app8] to do better. You'll never have that question in your mind of what it would've been like to have a father.
I don't particularly believe in psychics myself, but [app2] a situation of desperation, most people, including me, would do whatever it takes to get things done. A friend of mine had a sister that was missing for almost 2 years, her family finally decided to use a psychic, between the police and the psychic, her sisters body was found.
Not at all. These people need to be stopped before they hurt a child. If you are worried go back to the chat room and ask what they do to keep you safe. I don't think you can be traced by the paedo though because of [app15] protection. If you are still worried, [app17] police and explain the situation and say that you are worried about it. They will [app20] they can to keep you safe.
What does that mean?Companies can advertise that their [app2] are better than their competitors' products. They are even encouraged to use images of their competitors' [app8] in their ads. This encourages competition and as long as they aren't intentionally trying to confuse people, fair use protects such use of trademarks and copyrights.By the way, there is no such thing as truth in advertisement so no evidence is required to make such claims.Edit: The legal departments of most companies won't let them make libelous ads. There's a difference between saying "Product A is better than product B" and "Company A is better than company B because they kill young children and then eat them".
The [app0] very good or I might have marked this lower. The food was super expensive and boring. The sliders I got weren't cooked all of the way through and the buns were greasy. Other than the service I did like the fries. I would order the fries and sit at the bar as [app18] not order the sliders again.
I think [app0] uniform is a good idea. First it's [app3] look [app4] and tidy. Second we can know [app7] is study in which school or who is in a same school [app11] and finally it's convenient because we don't have to spend to much of time to choose clothes to school
can be recycled to make other things. like more water bottles. it also [app4] water companys rich. theyre not expensive, its like 3 bucks for one of those big packs at shaws. that will keep you un-thirsty for a couple weeks for [app14] change.
Yes, because who knows if they will [app2] you and than one night that you less expect it they will try to kill [app8] its on their mind that you know the truth and the truth cant get out and they need to get rid of all types of clues even of those they love just incase they try to talk to someone.
I believe that personal pursuit is better because one must themselves happy before they can go out into the world and try to make everyone else happy. If you try to make everyone else happy and you leave no time for you, then you become a wreak and then you have no happiness in your life. Some people find that helping others is their own pursuit of happiness.
This is just my opinion, but I think it would be [app3] than to have a lousy father. I mean i was always tought that a true man should be someone respectable, honest, nd hard working, if he's not a that kind of man [app15] doesn't deserve to be a father in the first place. Besides just because you don't have a father that doesn't mean you can't have aa father figuer in you life.
I believe that personal pursuit is better because in order to help others you have to help yoursel first. I also think that if you are happy with yourself and enjoy helping others you have the confidence and strength to help the outside world while satisfying yourself. For example, someone wants to succeed in life and through that he achieves his goals, whenever he is already succesful and with money he decides to help others.
The emotional part of me supports the death penalty...i know if someone killed a family member i would want them to face the ultimate punishment.But the rational and prevailing part of me opposes the death penalty because of the risk of innocent people being killed. People think DNA is the killsafe...it is not..not all cases involve DNA and those convicted before the use of DNA often cannot get appeals to have the test performed. So oppose it, lest I or someone I know faces the fate of the unknown amount of innocents sentenced to death.
Yes. If you get caught later on, you'll get fired, and then you'll have to explain an even [app6] gap in your employment history. If you're going to make it on the outside, you have to put the felony behind an uninterrupted work-history, so you can't afford to get fired. Get a short term job, if necessary, and then find a better one. Be reliable especially at short-term jobs, though, because you really don't want to lose that reference. Good luck.
Can they sue [app1] if you are outside the US? Yes.Can they sue [app4] if they cannot find you? Yes. The court will give them [app9] to advertise the case in the newspaper in the area where they think you are.So, if you don't show up in thesuit you don't know about can they win a judgment? Yes.But now they have a judgment in a US court for US money. How will they enforce the judgment? If they can find assets of yours like bank accounts in the US, they can sieze those. But if all of your money is outside the country (actually, even outside the state where the suit was brought) it is going to be a nightmare for them to collect the money. I mean, they'll have to take the judgment to a foreign court and have it translated and it'll just be a mess.So you're probably safe. Not 100% definitely safe but about 87% pretty much safe.
Race shouldn't even be a factor within a "diverse" community. Regardless of race everyone is still unique. Nobody should have to feel like they're just like everyone else because of their race.No two people are alike. Everyone is born with different interests, beliefs, and physical characteristics. Now, I'm [app16] it's alright to purposely exclude members of different races, but they should not have to be integrated into communities of one race in order to make it more "diverse". Moreover, even within a single race there are numerous differences in appearance and skin colour. Race really shouldn't matter that much.
I honestly think that Fascism can be a positive and good thing for a nation and it's [app5] it is done correctly with a great [app8] such as FDR, obviously it doesn't work with horrible people like Hitler or Mussolini but what about Hideki Tojo, in my opinion he was a pretty good [app18] with his people's hopes in front of him, only to make bad choices by [app20] Axis. Though he still knew when it was time to give up and even stopped causing the blood of his people to be shed after seeing the destruction of the Atomic Bomb. So what would happen if Fascism still existed, with a competent and great [app20] in control? My opinion, is that it would become prosperous.
Dark Knight is a grand epic, but Year One’s strength is in its subtleties. It’s more crime comic then a superhero tale, where Batman fights dirty cops and the mob with few gadgets (and no Robin). Mazzuchelli’s realistic art matches the mood perfectly. Batman looks like an athlete in a rental costume, not a bodybuilder in body paint. Miller writes Bruce Wayne as less [app20] driven and more noble in motivation. My only complaint is that they should have made more than four issues.
I'll start off by saying that this was my [app3] at a Tim Horton's and had heard good things. We went for breakfast before our train back to the States. I had the BELT (Bacon, Egg, Lettuce, Tomato) on a pretzel bagel. The bagel did not taste [app16] and the eggs could barely be found. My girlfriend had the bacon, egg and cheese [app20] English muffin. This thing was TINY and would have made an Egg McMuffin look big.Somehow they ran out of hash browns but didn't realize it until after we paid. They offered us a doughnut instead but we didn't want that. The coffee was so hot that you couldn't hold the cup more than 10 seconds. Because that we had to throw it out. We were already delayed and had to catch a train so we chalked it up as a loss.
I fell like advancing the common goods is better [app3] most people will look [app5] themselves rather than look out for others. Looking [app9] yourself before lookin [app10] others won't do alot of [app13] run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also [app20] to you helping you better yourself.
In my opinion, I strongly agree [app2] as an [app4] discipline their children because the spankings are painful enough for children to learn to avoid doing the wrong things.
The concept that people have this *right* is an ethical question and I support [app4] that all have this right.Whether people actually have it is a legal question based on the laws of their country. China, for example, has government policies in place that restrict the [app15] the inhabitants can freely receive.In India, there are domestic rights organizations that are vigilant in protecting and preserving the citizens perceived rights including that of information. (1)Every country has a segment that would restrict information and any of the other qualities that are considered *rights*. Regardless of political party there are essentially two kinds of people; those who wish controls and those who do not want controls.
Every one has the right to have his own opinions, to be open about ‘em and to speak out loud his own thoughts, logical or not, you also have the right to listen to that [app11] not, to [app13] with your own ideas and opinions or to simply neglect him like if he doesn’t exist (of course if his ideas aren’t logical or acceptable)…It is a kind of oppression to define to people the way they should [app20] express themselves.
I actually believe that uniforms are good and in schools should be school uniforms. In this situation you don't have to constantly worry about what you're gonna wear every morning. And for it [app11] will be do any important thing which help to you in lessons. Yes, it might be a little boring putting on the same set of clothes but it's less costly this way, and you do not have to go on shopping trips so regularly.
Having a Lousy father would be better [app2] fatherless. If you have a Lousy father you can look at his mistakes, and avoid them. Also being fatherless would be hard [app10] and your mom. You would have no example or any kind [app14] to look up to. If you need help, at least you have your father [app20] lend you a hand, even if he is lousy.
I think [app0] not spank because there's other way to make them behave.
Personally i think that if you are not helping yourself you cant help no one else. If you try to help every person that needs your help, they will just slow you down. Don't get [app11] helping people is always right. In the big picture if you pursuit your dreams and get rich, fame, and power you will be able to help the people that matter to you.
IE7 on Vista supports protected mode which runs the browser in a security context that has minimal access to your computer and private information. Both Firefox and IE are internet facing apps with occasional security issues, so I prefer the browser with better security architecture.
I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The [app12] have a friendly relationship with [app14] and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.
It might be against the teachings of the bible etc... [app3] because a gay relationship bears no offspring which is why it was banned.Also it was seen to weaken the position of men.Time have changed... its time to accept.
Strangely enough in New Zealand the crown has been made to pay compensation for breach of treaty with the intengenous people. Despite the treaty not being recognised at international law. There have been a number of other treaties established during the colonising period, which if New Zelanad is precedent should burden the common wealth. Personally I am in the view that these indiginous peoples did not have the state sovereignty and capacity to enter into international relations that has been a corner stone in international law. I think that if Britain was to compensate pruely for war losses, then arguably America would owe Vietnam for breach of state sovereignty, Germany would owe Russia for breach of non agression pact (contract), and Greece would owe Iran for breach of Kings peace. I think there would be a indeterminate burden of [app20] and any orders to make effect such a action would be unjust on the world as it exists today
The death penalty is not revenge. Instead that, it is the punishment assigned a person after having been found guilty of a crime by a jury of his peers.There are laws that determine what crimes and under what circumstances a person may be eligible for the death penalty if he is convicted. This may not be a matter of "revenge" by the state - but might felt so by the victims' family. Finding an individual guilty and later putting him to death provides a form of closure for the victim's family.. In some states, most prisoners only get life [app20] without any opportunity for parole.
Animal [app0] should be allowed (under strict conditions) until there is a viable alternative that is as cheap and effective as animal testing. Those strict conditions should include: a suitable habitat for the animal, a decent diet, no cruel treatment, and only for certain, specified diseases or malaises. They should not use animal [app17] for products such as make-up or perfume, but if they are [app20] a drug that may be a cure for cancer, animal [app20] is possibly the best route to take, as it is cheap and yet one of the most effective tests available.
Plastic can kill many types [app1] species. There have been 26 pieces of fish found in one single fish. Fish are extremly vital to the environment as a food source for birds which eat bugs therfore the cycle of life.
I believe politicians don't have the knowledge and know-how on how to run a country. We seen over and over again multiple cases of corruption, bankrupcy all over the world, and country failing to maintain a positive economy. Most of the solutions come from an assembly where politicians reunite and discuss those solutions. Most of the time they fail [app19] a good one.In the early 1900s there was a movement called Technocracy movement which wanted to replace politicians with engineers and scientists specialized in each area they running (e.g education would be run by someone connected to it that has spent a majority of [app20] studying education)I believe our politic system isn't been run like it should. CMV^P.S: English isn't [app20] language, I hope I made myself clear
This argument is very close to [app2] the moment, an ex-friend of mine who is 17 years old has had unprotected sex with a minor of whom is not even totally "developed" yet.He sees no wrong in what he is doing even though he is:a. Breaking the law.b. Aware he is breaking the lawc. Proud of it.Personally, I think that it is not all that hard to wait until you are 16, after all, if teens are sexually active at such a young age, it could cause such problems as teenage pregnancy, STD's and even permanent damage to their bodies.I personally see it as a foul thing, for people often regret it when they are older, it can cause irreperable mental and physical damage and is simpy morally wrong.I'm not [app20] support no sex before marriage, but sex before [app20] really know what it is, is a different story.
This piece is a call to action in the UK to put a stop to the governments big brother program. Londons Westimister Council are further compounding the problem that people don't trust the government and their surveillance of British people by taking away something that most people [app15] want to keep.Additionally, Banksy has made what was once a boring ugly wall something interesting, engaging and poignant. He is a celebrated artist in his own right and Westiminster Council should recognise this piece as a gift to be embraced rather than erased.
Slow service , too expensive , weird chairs with wheels on. I [app4] a [app4] of Sashimi which tasted OK but not worthy of [app8] tab. Also had a [app10] noodle dish , very mediocre small amount of [app13] with huge lumps of tofu. Wine is $13 a glass! 6 of us [app17] there , nothing extravagant 2 wines , 2 beers $174 before tip. Yikes. Don't bother.
Worst buffet I've ever been to. I preferred the $5.99 China Buffet I tried once. Food [app5] bland, [app6] was small, salads were wilted, no sign of vegetables anywhere, gravy was congealed and the "roast beef" was the size of my fist and then they slice off 2 paper thin slices for you. Also was extremely overpriced at $19 on a Tuesday night. Better off going to Mandarin.
Usually my decision in the end is yes and no,or goes both ways. Today, however it is advancing for the common good. Making a [app8] better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in [app12] run who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help [app19] other people. If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.
Murder under any circumstance is not right. A person who commits the act knows the consequences, and they know that they are guilty. I wouldn't be able to look at my spouse the same ever again. I would not be able to live with the secret of a murder.So yea, i would [app17] in.
I heard about this on [app1] this morning. IMO, he had a choice whether or not to perform the act that resulted in the baby. Even if she says she is on birth control, or he uses a condom, it does not matter. The only 100% safe birth control is not to do it. So if he went ahead with the act and she accidently got pregnant, he is just as responsible as she is.On the other hand, if she intentionally got pregnant, and knew he [app20] desire to have a child, then he may have a case. But that will [app20] hard to prove. I also agree that the child should not be punished or suffer because of this, but neither should the father.But this is just my opinion.
I often see criticisms of the use of burqas and other pieces of clothing meant to cover up Muslim women. I have read countless online discussions and seen many television debates/newscasts critiquing the role of burqas within the Muslim religion. However, nobody seems to acknowledge that the west does the [app16] thing with breasts.In most places, women must cover up their breast in public, websites consider it nudity and will censor these videos/images, and even if it is legal, it is often frowned down on by the public. We have sexualized breasts and therefore have forbidden them from being exposed publicly, how is this different from preventing women from exposing their faces or legs?I invite you [app20] CMV.
Currently, I am just curious and possibly wondering about the [app3] of evil or bad people. When I think of people that the USA (Yes, I am American) consider bad, my mind trends toward Putin, Osama bin Laden, and other people that oppose capitalism and western ideas. In the media and in schools, we are taught that these people are evil, but I don't think that the people that we consider evil wake up every morning and say,"Hey, I really think it is time for me to be evil, because I love being evil." I feel like these people may have ulterior motives or just a different opinion on the perception and actions of situations. ThanksEdit: Edit spelling
Hardly a day goes by without a democrat politician bemoaning the fact that we [app4] captured/killed Osama bin Laden. Yes, capturing or killing this man would be a great accomplishment. However, removing bin Laden from the planet would do little or nothing to stop terrorism. Terrorists, even islamic ones in Indonesia would likely not be impressed by the death of a single man.
I'm not saying it should be english, but there should be one official language we use [app5] with each other.We would be able to do business much better, understand everyone, and [app10] ideas properly. The internet has given us all the ability to [app14] with each other, all we need now is the same language.I'm [app18] destroy other languages, but it would be nice to have one official one.
I think the birth mother should have the right for "no contact." There could, however, be an intermediary who could be contacted in the [app8] of a medical emergency.Women need to have this safeguard so they won’t feel pressured by the judgemental spirits of others about their unwanted pregnancy. It’s very sad that abortions are [app18] chosen because of these reasons.
Yeah, it is. A religious debate accomplishes nothing. rather insults are passed [app4] side or the other is seriously ganged against and belittled for their personal beliefs. Nobody will actually change their beliefs because somebody quotes scientific or Biblical 'evidence' that may or may not exist or be a firm as is made sound.Furthermore, speaking [app18] sides, both have faults and apparent oppenings of unexplained, so each side will just pick eachother apart as able.
Went in on a Monday night. There were several servers there however, none came to even take our drink order for [app7] minutes so we left. Manager came by at one point and asked how we were doing as he walked by but he asked and kept walking. Why ask how I'm doing if you clearly don't care or want to know why which is evidenced by the pace of your gate around the restaurant. Mind boggling!
