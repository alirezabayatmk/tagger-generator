The [app0] in bottled water production has [app2] water extraction in areas near bottling plants, leading to water shortages that [app6] nearby consumers and farmers. In addition to the millions of gallons of water used in the plastic-making process, two gallons of water are wasted in the purification process [app16] gallon that goes into the bottles.
*For the international CMVs the term greek refers to a social component of my university that throws open [app6] every weekend. Each party has a theme/dress code.*A lot of people may say that to a certain extent everything is alright in fun and humor, but I believe that organizing [app16] with dress codes that allow people to dress up as racial stereotypes should be frowned upon and ultimately banned.By allowing these [app20] to go on as a college community, we are furthering the segregation, discrimination, and undermining of our international cultures as they are portrayed as a "joke" to those who attend in attire.Ultimately, by forbidding the use of these themes (in favor of more non racially specific [app20] themes such as black light or tropical) we are protecting the integrity of our international and ethnical students, while very little harm is done on the greek end.
So, if you are on a beer run with friends [app3] of them forgets their I.D. but they are not purchasing, requiring them to show I.D. is both a useless and inconvenient policy. I can understand why they would have it, but even following basic rational thought it doesn't make sense.There's nothing stopping the person buying the [app19] from walking out of the store, and walking right back in alone, to a different register or going to the next store over to do the same thing or ultimately, preventing any real [app20] on the part of wal-mart. If someone who is 21+ buys for a minor, the law will attack them, not the selling institution. All this does is discourage people from buying alcoholic [app20] at the store in the first place.CMV.
It is 6:53 PM and I wanted a juice. The [app3] behind the counter proceeded to tell me that they have already sanitized the juice machine for the night. Pulp does not close until 9 PM. What a horrible experience and terrible customer service. Pulp does not close for over two hours. Really?I have been coming here for about a month and during that time the wheatgrass shot machine has been down. I figured OK it is a small shop how long could it take but a month later (according to a Nother customer it's been almost 2 months) and still no wheatgrass. Now this. I will not be returning.
So I have been here before but now as Yama sushi has become so popular and big the sushi has 2x more rice than before and less fish, also [app9] has dropped to something impermissible, on too of the fact that they recently got a B- Health Inspection rating for 16 violations most of them being the fish not being kept at proper temperatures. Go somewhere else, or just make sure you get good service.
firefox [app0] better.It remembers passwords with greater gusto.add-ons allow you to personalize your browser in every way. I love - tabs (aging and remembering them when you close the browser, weatherfox, gestures,there is even a tab that lets you display the page in IE format if something is incompatible (rare, only SAP at work)and the way you can put the link logos in the tool bar rocks.much friendlier and a better browser, and not just because i don't want to support MS. Because i don't care about that, a good product is a good product.
I fell like advancing the common goods is better [app3] most people will look [app5] themselves rather than look [app7] others. Looking [app9] yourself before lookin [app10] others won't do alot of good in [app13] run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also [app20] to you helping you better yourself.
Children have two role models; mom and dad. Parents affect their child's behavior and personality so if that relationship is damaged then the child's character can be damaged as well. I would [app10] be fatherless because the damage of a lousy father would scar my personality far greater than being fatherless.
The internet is still such a recent phenomenon, that laws and policies are being created as we speak.But unless you're pretty certain they'll be OK with it, you should ask someone if you can put a link to their website on your blog. That would be the right thing to do [app17] ethical standpoint as well.A lot of people create 'banners' for other people to put on their websites as a link to their's. But some people don't mind if you put the URL.Bottom line is, when in doubt check it out. I can't answer your question about the legal ramifications (see link, below). But my bet is that you could end up getting into some hot water with someone if they haven't given you [app20] prior to your adding the link. Why risk it? It's just a matter of asking.
Not if it happened outside the workplace and after working hours. As far as I know, sexual harrassment only occurs when the person receiving the comment, approach, or inappropriate personal contact perceives it as insulting, demeaning, or threatening. Many people bend the sexual harrassment rules in the workplace by [app16] remarks from their co-workers. I think that policies against sexual harrassment exist only for the workplace environment (whichever this environment may be). But I believe that a person can get in trouble with the cops if he or she is accused of bothering another person in a sexual way.
Misinformed voting is a problem, and I think that introducing a way to cut down on the amount of misinformed votes is important. The test that would be implemented would not be very difficult, [app11] ensure that the voter had read [app14] before they vote. I believe something like this could be accomplished by trials in which sample populations who [app20] yet read [app20] would be allotted a certain amount of time to read the bill, and then answer a variety of multiple choice questions. From this information, researchers could pick and choose questions that those with a poor high school education could answer having read the bill. -EDIT-I would like to also say that this would be an 'open book' test; [app20] would literally be in front of them.
I was reading the post today about the supposed Malaria vaccine when it occurred to me that while it's terrific that this discovery will end the suffering of infected people and eradicate the potential to put more through that sickness, it will ultimately result in an increase in world population. Every new development in sickness prevention or life elongation contributes to the steady and inevitable increase in people on this earth. The bottom line is that people will [app20] die at a smaller rate while new people are [app20] born at a greater rate. The earth cannot sustain this. Is there another point of view that would help me enjoy these medical discoveries more? All I see is a bleak future fast approaching as more people live longer.
I believe the current situation in North Korea is no laughing matter yet when scrolling through comments on reddit, whenever there is a mention of North Korea, it is almost certain that a joke about it will follow. The jokes mask the reality of the situation and although a small [app16] the people commenting may actually believe in what they're saying, to most, the living conditions, mass executions, labor camps, and the [app20] of nuclear technology in North Korea is something we should be [app20] of [app20] take action [app20] the situation.I understand people have a right to joke about whatever they want, after all, they are just jokes. But to me, I find them just as insensitive and inappropriate as joking about the holocaust, other genocides, and injustices to human rights.And yes... I do expect the top comment to be a joke about being banned from /r/pyongyang
Sometimes a girl just wants some Matzoh Ball soup and this place is one [app4] faves... I will say it has been inconsistent from time to time (sometimes being less flavorful than others but that is not always the case--- I have been satisfied more times than not. Sandwich [app16] is good, veggie burger is one of the better ones I have tried, and they are generous with their portions. We often use Wheel Deliver to get the Smallman Street Deli and everything is always marked properly and the orders never have issues (unlike many places who do large lunches unfortunately). I will keep patronizing this yummy place...
I think it [app1] acceptable to break the law if, [app3] breaking it, [app5] suffer bodily harm or death. Also, if the law is fundamentally designed to discriminate, I think that at the very least some people need to break it in order to be able to argue against it in the Supreme Court, for example when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat.
Even [app0] is true that Raffles did [app2] closely with the population to develop Singapore, he provided plans, ideas and was going to put them in action by himself when his superiors ordered him to Bencoolen. Hence it was common sense for Raffles to leave his subordinate to finish his ideas
I volunteer at Irving Cares, and when I do I feel so great that I [app5] the community. To me when I help [app8] common good I am helping myself. When people do something for the good of others it helps them out in [app15] run. Whether it is a favor in return or anything else. In a personal pursuit you are just helping yourself. If we [app20] helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me.
Bush assumes it will put US at risk of loosing the edge in industrial production.The agreement will put stricter restrictions on emissions from various industries in america.To adhere to the standards america needs to upgrade a large number of industries.Another reason is these agreements will be fully implemented in usa but the other third world countries does not have the financial power or expertise [app20] it. So the third world countries will be polluting and [app20] cheap [app20] while US will be [app20] in new technologies and creating expensive products.But in [app20] run US will reap the benefits if it signs the environmental agreement, as we have only one earth.
Cannot believe didnot write a review for this placeLocated inside the Planet Hollywood and its open 24/7.Great [app5] go to when you have the munchies while yourRecommendations-Full Montagu..Beef and turkey..Its a very tasty sandwich .-Holiday Turkey..Wow it taste like a turkey plate with stuffing, turkey and cranberry. Very good if you like turkey.-Original...Just Ok..Its [app18] sandwich and it was nothing special.Usually stick to either Full Montagu or Holiday Turkey.All sandwiches are under $7 so what a deal!!!They also have salads and soups.Line moves pretty quickly so donot [app20] long line scare you away...
is it wrong? yes. unhealthy? yes. Addictive? yes. [app2] is smoking ciggarettes. just because its wrong doesn't mean it shouldn't exist.
I think that personal [app1] better because i think that [app3] before others is natural. I think that no matter what you do everything comes back [app9] if your helping others, because you dont want your life to be out of whack helping others.
Men have been [app1] hardest by the recession, and [app3] bounced back well. Lots of men [app5] unemployed, and men are going to college at lower numbers than ever.Meanwhile, women are being given incentives to go into colleges and fields that men are not.There exist lots of [app16] jobs (teaching and nursing are the most readily available and accessible examples) that are 90% female, both in the [app20] and in college majors. Considering the higher male unemployment, I think anyone offering a female-specific incentive such as a STEM scholarship should be required to promote a male-specific scholarship to a female-dominated field.Please CMV.
Just look at our own bodies, we have residues of our ancestors, we shiver and get bimps like reptiles, our hair stands on its end when frightned and we all have tail bones, I am not an atheist, I believe in God, I just believe that God set things up with the creation of the universe knowing what would happen including that what was created woul evolve and turn into life and that life would continue to evolve, it's all part of the Master's plan-I have no conflict between believing in God and evolution and neither do a growing number of progressive believers of God of various denominations
I [app0] the argument that people are basically good. That is not to say that all people are good all of the time, or even that all people are basically good. Clearly we have had some rotten eggs. But that does not mean we are essentially evil, selfish things. Easily misled, perhaps, but not inherently bad. On an individual level, people are capable of great caring and impressive acts of selflessness.
I believe that the wearing of the school uniform should be encouraged because it reminds each child that they are equal (at least in school). It also shows unity and children feel [app10] and it helps them to work as a team.
It is better to have a lousy father than to be [app3] you will [app5] learn mistakes from and to give you [app8] to do better. You'll never have that question in your [app12] what it would've been like to have a father.
Not at all. These people need to be stopped before they hurt a child. If you are worried go back to the chat room and ask what they do to keep you safe. I don't think you can be traced by the paedo though because of [app15] protection. If you are still worried, contact the police and explain the situation and say that you are worried about it. They will do everything they can to keep you safe.
What does that mean?Companies can advertise that their [app2] are better than their competitors' products. They are even encouraged to use images of their competitors' [app8] in their ads. This encourages competition and as long as they aren't intentionally trying to confuse people, fair use protects such use of trademarks and copyrights.By the way, there is no such thing as truth in advertisement so no evidence is required to make such claims.Edit: The legal departments of most companies won't let them make libelous ads. There's a difference between saying "Product A is better than product B" and "Company A is better than company B because they kill young children and then eat them".
The service [app0] good or I might have marked this lower. The food was super expensive and boring. The sliders I got weren't cooked all of the way through and the buns were greasy. Other than [app12] I did like the fries. I would order the fries and sit at the bar as [app18] not order the sliders again.
Porn is anything but wrong in most cases. Sometimes it's in very bad taste, but when it's giving equal gratification, etc. to all parties, there's nothing wrong, and I could [app10] it an art form in some respects.
I think [app0] uniform is a good idea. First it's [app3] look [app4] and tidy. Second we can know that who is study in which school or who is in a same school with us and finally it's convenient because we don't have to spend to much of time to choose clothes to school
can be recycled to make other things. like more water bottles. it also [app4] water companys rich. theyre not expensive, its like 3 bucks for one of those big packs at shaws. that will keep you un-thirsty for a couple weeks for [app14] change.
Yes, because [app0] if they [app2] and than one night that you less expect it they will try to kill [app8] its on their mind that you know the truth and the truth cant get out and they need to get rid of all types of clues even of those they love just incase they try to talk to someone.
I believe that personal [app1] better because one must themselves happy before they can go out into the world and try to make everyone else happy. If you try to make everyone else happy and you leave no time for you, then you become a wreak and then you have no happiness in your life. Some people find that [app20] is their own pursuit of happiness.
I believe that personal [app1] better because in order to help others you have to help yoursel first. I also think that if you are happy with yourself and enjoy helping others you have the confidence and strength to help the outside world while satisfying yourself. For example, someone wants to succeed in life and through that he achieves his goals, whenever he is already succesful and with money he decides to help others.
The emotional part of me supports the death penalty...i know if someone killed a family member i would want them to face the ultimate punishment.But the rational and prevailing part of me opposes the death penalty because of the risk of innocent people being killed. People think DNA is the killsafe...it is not..not all cases involve DNA and those convicted before the use of DNA often cannot get appeals to have the test performed. So oppose it, lest I or someone I know faces the fate of the unknown amount of innocents sentenced to death.
Can they sue you even if you are outside the US? Yes.Can they sue [app4] if they cannot find you? Yes. The court will give them [app9] to advertise the case in the newspaper in the area where they think you are.So, if you don't show up in thesuit you don't know about can they win a judgment? Yes.But now they have a judgment in a US court for US money. How will they enforce the judgment? If they can find assets of yours like bank accounts in the US, they can sieze those. But if all of your money is outside the country (actually, even outside the state where the suit was brought) it is going to be a nightmare for them to collect the money. I mean, they'll have to take the judgment to a foreign court and have it translated and it'll just be a mess.So you're probably safe. Not 100% definitely safe but about 87% pretty much safe.
Race shouldn't even be a factor within a "diverse" community. Regardless of race everyone is still unique. Nobody should have to feel like they're just like everyone else because of their race.No two people are alike. Everyone is born with different interests, beliefs, and physical characteristics. Now, I'm [app16] it's alright to purposely exclude members of different races, but they should not have to be integrated into communities of one race in order to make it more "diverse". Moreover, even within a single race there are numerous differences in appearance and skin colour. Race really shouldn't matter that much.
I honestly think that Fascism can be a positive and good thing for a nation and it's people if it is done correctly with a great [app8] such as FDR, obviously it doesn't work with horrible people like Hitler or Mussolini but what about Hideki Tojo, in my opinion he was a pretty good [app18] with his people's hopes in front of him, only to make bad choices by supporting the Axis. Though he still knew when it was time to give up and even stopped causing the blood of his people to be shed after seeing the destruction of the Atomic Bomb. So what would happen if Fascism still existed, with a [app20] and great [app20] in control? My opinion, is that it would become prosperous.
I'll start off by saying that this was my [app3] at a Tim Horton's and had heard good things. We went for breakfast before our train back to the States. I had the BELT (Bacon, Egg, Lettuce, Tomato) on a pretzel bagel. The bagel did not taste [app16] and the eggs could barely be found. My girlfriend had the bacon, egg and cheese on an English muffin. This thing was TINY and would have made an Egg McMuffin look big.Somehow they ran out of hash browns but didn't realize it until after we paid. They offered us a doughnut instead but we didn't want that. The coffee was so hot that you couldn't hold the cup more than 10 seconds. Because that we had to throw it out. We were already delayed and had to catch a train so we chalked it up as a loss.
I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal [app3] most people will look out [app6] rather than look [app7] others. Looking [app9] yourself before lookin [app10] others won't do alot of good in [app13] run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also [app20] to you helping you better yourself.
In my opinion, I strongly agree that [app2] use [app3] as an [app4] discipline their children because the spankings are painful enough for children to learn to avoid doing the wrong things.
The concept that people have this *right* is an ethical question and I support the position that all have this right.Whether people actually have it is a legal question based on the laws of their country. China, for example, has government policies in place that restrict the [app15] the inhabitants can freely receive.In India, there are domestic rights organizations that are vigilant in protecting and preserving the citizens perceived rights including that of information. (1)Every country has a segment that would restrict [app20] and any of the other qualities that are considered *rights*. Regardless of political party there are essentially two kinds of people; those who wish controls and those who do not want controls.
Every one has the right to have his own opinions, to be open about ‘em and to speak out loud his own thoughts, logical or not, [app8] have the right to listen to that [app11] not, to [app13] with your own ideas and opinions or to simply neglect him like if he doesn’t exist (of course if his ideas aren’t logical or acceptable)…It is a kind of oppression to define to people the way they should [app20] express themselves.
Having a Lousy father would be better [app2] fatherless. If you have a Lousy father you can look at his mistakes, and avoid them. Also being fatherless would be hard [app10] and your mom. You would have no example or any kind of person to look up to. If you need help, at least you have your father [app20] lend you a hand, even if he is lousy.
I think [app0] not spank because there's other way to make them behave.
Personally i think that if you are not [app2] you cant help no one else. If you try to help every [app7] needs your help, they will just slow you down. Don't get [app11] helping people is always right. In the big picture if you pursuit your dreams and get rich, fame, and power you will be able to help the people [app20] to you.
IE7 on Vista supports protected mode which runs the browser in a security context that has minimal access to your computer and private information. Both Firefox and IE are internet facing apps with occasional security issues, so I prefer the browser with better security architecture.
I strongly believe [app1] not use physical punishment like spanking to [app4] their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The [app12] have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.
It might be against the teachings of the bible etc... [app3] because a gay relationship bears no offspring which is why it was banned.Also it was seen to weaken [app10] of men.Time have changed... its time to accept.
Strangely enough in New Zealand the crown has been made to pay compensation for breach of treaty with the intengenous people. Despite the treaty not being recognised at international law. There have been a number of other treaties established during the colonising period, which if New Zelanad is precedent should burden the common wealth. Personally I am in the view that these indiginous peoples did not have the state sovereignty and capacity to enter into international relations that has been a corner stone in international law. I think that if Britain was to compensate pruely for war losses, then arguably America would owe Vietnam for breach of state sovereignty, Germany would owe Russia for breach of non agression pact (contract), and Greece would owe Iran for breach of Kings peace. I think there would be a indeterminate burden of [app20] and any orders to make effect such a action would be unjust on the world as it exists today
The death penalty is not revenge. Instead that, it is the punishment assigned a person after having been found guilty of a crime by a jury of his peers.There are laws that determine what crimes and under what circumstances a person may be eligible for the death penalty if he is convicted. This may not be a matter of "revenge" by the state - but might felt so by the victims' family. Finding an individual guilty and later putting him to death provides a form of closure for the victim's family.. In some states, most prisoners only get life [app20] without any opportunity for parole.
Animal [app0] should be allowed (under strict conditions) until there is a viable alternative that is as cheap and effective as animal testing. Those strict conditions should include: a suitable habitat for the animal, a decent diet, no cruel treatment, and only for certain, specified diseases or malaises. They should not use animal testing for [app18] such as make-up or perfume, but if they are [app20] a drug that may be a cure for cancer, animal [app20] is possibly the best route to take, as it is cheap and yet one of the most effective tests available.
your argument doesn't hold validity since in [app2] you sited, the mental stability and ability to reason are completely compromised. The state intervenes in the cases in instances of mental illness.You will need to find a better answer. Sorry. Try again.
I believe politicians don't have the knowledge and know-how on how to run a country. We seen over and over again multiple cases of corruption, bankrupcy all over the world, and country failing to maintain a positive economy. Most of the solutions come from an assembly where politicians reunite and discuss those solutions. Most of the time they fail [app19] a good one.In the early 1900s there was a movement called Technocracy movement which wanted to replace politicians with engineers and scientists specialized in each area they running (e.g education would be run by someone connected to it that has spent a majority of her life studying education)I believe our politic system isn't been run like it should. CMV^P.S: English isn't my mother language, I hope I made myself clear
This argument is very close to [app2] the moment, an ex-friend of mine who is 17 years old has had unprotected sex with a minor of whom is not even totally "developed" yet.He sees no [app12] what he is doing even though he is:a. Breaking the law.b. Aware he is breaking the lawc. Proud of it.Personally, I think that it is not all that hard to wait until you are 16, after all, if teens are sexually active at such a young age, it could cause such problems as teenage pregnancy, STD's and even permanent damage to their bodies.I personally see it as a foul thing, for people often regret it when they are older, it can cause irreperable mental and physical damage and is simpy morally wrong.I'm not [app20] support no sex before marriage, but sex before [app20] really know what it is, is a different story.
This piece is a call to action in the UK to put a stop to the governments big brother program. Londons Westimister Council are further compounding the problem that people don't trust the government and their surveillance of British people by taking away something that most people [app15] want to keep.Additionally, Banksy has made what was once a boring ugly wall something interesting, engaging and poignant. He is a celebrated artist in his own right and Westiminster Council should recognise this piece as a gift to be embraced rather than erased.
Slow service , too expensive , [app2] chairs with wheels on. I ordered a [app4] of Sashimi which tasted OK but not worthy of [app8] tab. Also had a [app10] noodle dish , very mediocre small amount of [app13] with huge lumps of tofu. Wine is $13 a glass! 6 of us ate there , nothing extravagant 2 wines , 2 beers $174 before tip. Yikes. Don't bother.
Worst buffet I've ever been to. I preferred the $5.99 China Buffet I [app4] once. Food was very bland, [app6] was small, salads were wilted, no sign of vegetables anywhere, gravy was congealed and the "roast beef" was the size [app13] fist and then they slice off 2 paper thin slices for you. Also was extremely overpriced at $19 on a Tuesday night. Better off going to Mandarin.
Usually my decision in the end is yes and no,or goes both ways. Today, however it is advancing for the common good. Making a [app8] better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in [app12] run [app13] it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help yourself and other people. If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.
Murder under any circumstance is not right. A person who commits the act knows the consequences, and they know that they are guilty. I wouldn't be able to look at my spouse the same ever again. I would not be able to live with the secret of a murder.So yea, i would [app17] in.
I heard about this on the news this morning. IMO, he had a choice whether or not to perform the act that resulted in the baby. Even if she says she is on birth control, or he uses a condom, it does not matter. The only 100% safe birth control is not to do it. So if he went ahead with [app20] and she accidently got pregnant, he is just as responsible as she is.On the other hand, if she intentionally got pregnant, and knew he had no desire to have a child, then he may have a case. But that will probably be hard to prove. I also agree that the child should not be punished or suffer because of this, but neither should the father.But this is just my opinion.
I often see criticisms of the use of burqas and other pieces of clothing meant to cover up Muslim women. I have read countless online discussions and seen many television debates/newscasts critiquing the role of burqas within the Muslim religion. However, nobody seems to acknowledge that the west does the [app16] thing with breasts.In most places, women must cover up their breast in public, websites consider it nudity and will censor these videos/images, and even if it is legal, it is often frowned down on by the public. We have sexualized breasts and therefore have forbidden them from being exposed publicly, how is this different from preventing women from exposing their faces or legs?I invite you [app20] CMV.
Currently, I am just curious and possibly wondering about the [app3] of evil or bad people. When I think of people that the USA (Yes, I am American) consider bad, my mind trends toward Putin, Osama bin Laden, and other people that oppose capitalism and western ideas. In the media and in schools, we are taught that these people are evil, but I don't think that the people that we consider evil wake up every morning and say,"Hey, I really think it is time for me to be evil, because I love being evil." I feel like these people may have ulterior motives or just a different opinion on the perception and actions of situations. ThanksEdit: Edit spelling
I'm [app0] it should be english, but there should be one official language we use to [app5] with each other.We would be able to do business much better, understand everyone, and [app10] ideas properly. The internet has given us all the ability [app14] with each other, all we need now is the same language.I'm [app18] destroy other languages, but it would be nice to have one official one.
I think the birth mother should have the right for "no contact." There could, however, be an intermediary who could be contacted in the [app8] of a medical emergency.Women need to have this safeguard so they won’t feel pressured by the judgemental spirits of others about their unwanted pregnancy. It’s very sad that abortions are frequently chosen because of these reasons.
Yeah, it is. A religious debate accomplishes nothing. rather insults are passed [app4] side or the other is seriously ganged against and belittled for their personal beliefs. Nobody will actually change their beliefs because somebody quotes scientific or Biblical 'evidence' that may or may not exist or be a firm as is made sound.Furthermore, speaking [app18] sides, both have faults and apparent oppenings of unexplained, so each side will just pick eachother apart as able.
The only other choices are, [inapp1] or keep it.And I know many children get adopted but many don'tand it might be better off [inapp7] have an abortion tolet them suffer.That's the chance they take, I guess. But who are we todecide one womans pregnancy.
Who are we to judge what is [inapp2] wrong? Can we not just let people make decisions and live with the consequences?
I am an American, and I am ashamed to admit "Merica is rich due to slavery. India never had slavery and used to be rich [inapp8] British came and took everything away. We were left in a bad state, but started developing quickly. India is much more competitive in education than America and soon when everyone has education (which will happen in our lifetime) India will excel.India has the potential.
All my life I've grown up around religious people, always telling me abortion was wrong, murder, and immoral. But I [inapp6] realized, it's not really a fully [inapp9] human, how could it be murder? This never made any sense, it's someone's body, if they want to abort a pregnancy, let them. Don't shame them into having a [inapp19] based on religious views. Anyway, I'm rambling, but I'm interested to see other views on this, so go ahead and try to change my view. If it matters, I'm Christian, 16, and male.
Well, I hate to be a downer, guys, but I don't think humanity has another 100 years left (give or take a few years). I want to believe that things will be alright, but when you keep hearing worse and worse news about the environmental degradation of the planet (even if you are still somehow a climate-change denier, you have to admit the oceans are massively polluted and huge amounts of fish are dying, the air in some parts of the world like China is almost unbreathable and getting worse, etc.), it's hard to see humans coming out of this ok. I hate to say it, but I don't [inapp20] have another century left. Please tell me why I'm wrong.Edit: Just to be clear, I'm not talking about human extinction. We'll probably survive whatever happens to some degree. I mean I think that society will likely collapse. Humans may still be around, but in a Mad Max/The Road/Book of Eli type of existence.
I have a strong opinion that before having children, the prospective parents should have to [inapp5] a series of background and IQ tests.Kids being brought into this world need a good foundation to start a successful life with. You may have that limited case where the parents are morons and the kids strive to be different then their failure parents, but in most cases it is an endless line of parasites on our world.We need more smart people.
with the cream layer quota system i don't prefer india to be leading the world in near future.....yes india have the potential.. but [inapp7] , this quota system ( not helpful to anyone) , and the main reason brain drain , don't specialy help india in the matter....
Sorry, one more thing:I think it's interesting that SINGTHESTORY and SIBTIGER haven't responded to my explanation of WHY I find [inapp6] a less than desirable alternative to abortion....Funny how people just IGNORE what they can't or don't want to argue against.If you're going to write a [inapp15] to someone's argument on here, then click "view all" first. This gives you a [inapp20] their arguments and it may help to eliminate the need for that person to REPEAT themselves by addressing something they've already addressed.
A women and she alone is the one who should determine if she wants [inapp4] or not, at any stage of her pregnancy. Why is that it is mostly older [inapp10] are attempting to establish anti-abortion laws for women? Why is it that most anit-abortionists are pro-death penalty?Jon Jax 71
You lost me--- 99% of what you say speaks IN FAVOR [inapp3] and AGAINST creationism--- At most [inapp6] out that science doesn't have all the answers (no scientist would try to counter you on that one) and that there may easily be halfway point between faith/science where [inapp16] can co-exist (a great many [inapp19] theologians and even agnostics would have [inapp20] problem with that idea)
What i dont undertsand is how people rationalize taking life it just doesnt [inapp4] sense... idc the [inapp6] america how is killing leagal?
You know I really don't see why not? After all people in Europe are allowed to drink at the age of 16-Germany---and in Mexico the drinking age was 18 until now that it's 21. I think the reason why it's 21 is because people in the US [inapp15] freaking retarded and dont' know how to act right. Why in foreign countries the drinking age is lower and [inapp20] have less [inapp20] or anyother problems? Think about that!
Towed three times and impounded for 30 days each time? Man, you're just not getting the message, are you?If you are in California, you bet the police can forfeit your vehicle and it doesn't take three times to make it a charm. Technically, your vehicle could be subject to forfeiture proceedings after your first suspended license beef. Someone like you is exactly the reason the legislature designed that law, because your privilege to drive has been taken away from you and yet you obviously continue to drive. People like you are involved in an exponentially higher than average number of traffic [inapp20] so the legislature figured maybe people like you should have your vehicles forfeited to the state if you just didn't go along with the game plan.Voila - I give you California Vehicle Code [inapp20] 14607.6...and a link to it below. It would also be worth your time to review 14607.4, whether or not you live in California.You really need to stop driving. Really.
It's a lottery - luck of the draw.It will decide a winner, to be sure.But the better team doesn't always win. And truthfully shoot outs are exciting as anything any other sport can produce but it's a [inapp12] and [inapp13] way to decide a game, especially at the level of the World Cup.The standard argument is that if 90 minutes in regulation time and 30 more in over time doesn't produce a winner another 30 (or more) won't either.Why not?How about removing players from each side as more and more overtime is played or allow more substitutes during OT?There are [inapp20] options that can be used besides shoot outs but everyone seems to be ok with this style of game play.It is an unfair, and truthfully a sissy way to decide something so important.CMV
As humans, we cannot know exactly if there is a higher force or not. Christianity however is not it. Firstly because it is not one [inapp8] every Christian shares, it lacks solidarity. I compare it to a road with all different kinds of sideways. Ask a question about religion, and lots of people will find one of those sideways to adjust their religion to their personal beliefs.With Atheïsm, the concept is pretty clear. It is more scientific, and I like that.
Ethically, it's not okay for anyone to invade the privacy of an innocent person. It's stupid and potentially dangerous to stalk celebrities, and many suits have been brought against various photographers and publications. However, we have the right to know what the government is doing-- because it's [inapp15] money. Governments steal from us, then use the fruits of their theft against us.Anyone [inapp20] that the 4th Amendment protects our privacy from the government is living under a rock. The 4th has been effectively nullified by SSNs, gun records, [inapp20] search & seizure to look for a "probable cause", phone tapping, and the fact that the government is so vast and powerful that businesses are being forced to collude with bureaucrats and hand over what little privacy we had left.
They don't do that. It's a hollywood thing. I've been to court many times (to observe, not as a witness or anything) and I've never seen [inapp8] that. They only ask you [inapp11] your right hand and say "I swear the statement I am about to give is the truth." Or something similar. That's all.
I feel like Physical [inapp1] be mandatory because people need there exercise. If they don't get physical activity they wont burn as much fats as they accumulate thus will get chubbier. They should be stricter during those classes of Physical education because a lot of the time people mostly just stand around. I don't want to seem sexist, but the ones [inapp20] the least exercise are the girls and they just [inapp20] stand there and socialize. They need a way to keep everyone active, people need to get moving! They need this for there health!
of cz [inapp0] must be taught but mustn"t b compulsory coz sme of us are not fit 2 du the extensive exersises perfomed
Simply WrittenSeeking to advance the Common goodallows doors to be opened and barriers to bebroken, and after a journey (or) series ofconsiderate acts [inapp7] have an less-difficulttime Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.The [inapp11] is[sacrifice]How much would a person really "sacrifice"for his or her neighbor without beingblinded by the light beemed from selfishness??No matter where a person is in thier life....Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!
If you are with your children, supervising them, then you wouldn't need a registry to do it for you. It is your responsibility as a parent to supervise your children at all times. If you will look at the horrendous crimes against children, they are children that were not being supervised by a parent. Also, 90 to 95% of sex offenses occur by someone known to the child within the family or close friends. Stranger danger is not all that prevalent and the registries do nothing but provide a [inapp20] sense of security.
People always talk about how [inapp1] it is to discriminate against people, but I see tons of discrimination and hatred against the rich (especially on reddit). I think this discrimination is just as morally wrong as all other forms of discrimination. America is always talked about as a free society and a land of equality, but how free and equal can it be if it charges certain people more for being more productive?!?! Additional taxes and discrimination on the [inapp20] also serve the effect of discouraging this behavior (or encouraging it to happen elsewhere where Americans don't benefit from spillover effects), and our subsidy system for poor people (especially regarding reproduction) has grown the ranks of the poor by millions.
Being horny is a sin.Wanking is a sinHaving sex with your girlfriend is a sinRaping is a sinIf this is what young men are taught, how can they have an concept of what wrong and right actually are. We should teach morals not religion.Religion teaches natural feelings are wrong. You don't tell a woman feeling cold is wrong so why tell a man acting on hornyness is wrong? I'm not say [inapp20] is right just that consential sex with a girlfirend is not wrong and putting the two in the same context of a 'sin' is causing rape.
my friend is, in my opinion, being stupid. she is gonna move to texas to a place where she will be in the minority. 13% of the entire town is white. [inapp10] gang territory. not far from the mexican border. leaveing everything behind, includeing family and friends. most people [inapp16] to stay. What [inapp18] think?
Well I definitely would stick by my vows of marriage through the good times and the bad but I mean some people get married without truly knowing who the person is. Hmmm that is a hard one. Well if I truly loved [inapp14] I would not turn them in because, I mean I made a promise to them that they could turn to me for help in thick and thin [inapp20] death do us part. But there are divorces that happen all the time because for whatever reason, but I don't know this is a toughy.
I would support the fact of being fatherless then having a lousy father. Fathers most likely are supposed to be the provider for the household and solve the problems [inapp9] in hand because his like the alpha male but if your lousy then what [inapp15] it for you to have around. Kids look towards their father as an example of how to be a [inapp20] to have responsibility's over the actions they make. so why not be fatherless when having a lousy father is the same thing.
I think it's better to have a lousy father then fatherless, because a father just being in the childs life has a huge impact on the child. Without a father, the child will not feel secure in a certain sense. Of course, mothers give that feeling, but fathers give it in another way. A [inapp18] for example, girls who have fathers are less careless then girls without. To me, I see girl's who don't have fathers grow up a hard life. Boys, they probably feel like they have to take on the fatherly responsiblity as [inapp20] older. Which shouldn't be the case.
We already have this, it is called the Social Security Card.Every employer can call the SSA and verify the information of a given social security number. Our government has just made it so difficult to do [inapp12] most employers will not take the time.When you are hired for a job, you are supposed to provide I-9 documentation. You can use a passport, or state issued id & social security card (not just number), or birth certificate & ss card, etc. There are already laws and fines in place regarding improperly documenting your workers. The problem is our elected officials would rather [inapp20] our money & time by presenting completely new regulations (justifying their jobs) instead of making the appropriate government administration enforce the laws we already have.Politicians are becoming better and better at doing nothing but creating redundent worthless laws. And we keep re-electing them.So I would NOT vote for this ridiculous limit on my freedom and [inapp20] of the American taxpayers' monies.
I haven't followed this political case, but I believe that any law named after a person is questionable since those pusing it will often be reacting based on emotion and grief, rather than reason.Any good law will have safeguards, and rational provisions so that whatever action is made illegal is really the action that is the threat. I generally oppose laws that make actions illegal just because they might, in combination with other actions, have the potential to cause harm. I believe in punishing those who cause the harm, and not limiting action based purely on speculation.That being said, the voting process has [inapp20] emotional one. People -- whether voters or legislators -- [inapp20] laws based on their gut reactions, often without any concern for the consequences or long term effects. Logic and reason have largely been abandoned in favor of making headlines.And sadly, that's not likely to change any time soon. Good luck.
If 1/2 the schools in the US thinks yes, then teachers are not doing well in the history aspect of education. Now, these kids need to know their rights, and [inapp10] of others. I thought schools get taught the Constitution and bill of rights. At least I would expect thee civil war to be mentioned before 6th grade, the rest would follow. Freedom of speech, FREEDOM OF PRESS, [inapp20] religion, and so on. With this knowledge [inapp20] understand why America is America and not new great Brittan or some British ruled country paying taxes on land we are not living and harvesting from. ( ha, nowadays, this country is doing all kinds of illegal activities. No wonder why 1/2 the youth is lost and confused)
Basically I am asserting since the storm-cloaks are painted as the [inapp3] villain out of the two choices their( the storm-cloaks and the empires war) is a [inapp9] of the skyrim story. Let's break down why the storm-cloaks are bad. They are racist they abuse and mistreat those different from them this makes them evil by today's morales and paints them( the storm-cloaks) as the villains and Ulfric as the mastermind. Secondly Ulfric used thu'um to kill the high king, basically he invoked an ancient and powerful gift to kill another bad guy deed. This is what makes the storm-cloaks the obvious bad guys they have nothing that paints them as good in any way except for not being the one to want to cut your head of at the beginning. Try to CMV by proving to me the storm-cloaks aren't just Saturday morning cartoon villains.
syona if look at glance, then most of us are [inapp3] specify any solid solutions by which we can remove the hurdle in our progress from root.we all are very much aware of problems but [inapp12] give solutions.they are criticizing government,terrorism and so on.no one realizes that being a citizen what is our duty?everyone should understand abt. their importance and role for country.Because a good citizen,a criminal,terrorist,corrupted politician, everyone is human, then why a human is creating problem for another human.I hope you will think my views and reply me soon.
Raffles unjustly removed Farquhar from his position in Singapore and accused him of ' being too close to the local population '. I think that it is [inapp9] that a person who contributed so much to Singapore's development be unjustly sent off like that.
i LIKE porn, jerking [inapp1] always a good time
[inapp0] better than books because you learn easier by seeing not read
Oil does rule all politics unfortunately. But can I suggest a simple alternative that we could all see as common sense? Use wind or wave power to generate electricity. Use this energy to split water into its prime components. Let oxygen into the air. Burn the Hydrogen in our cars and have water as the resulting by product. You could almost make this work in your back garden! We would only need lubricating oils then which could probably be [inapp20] from vegetable sources!
I feel that people should have the right to explore their own consciousness as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else in the process. Obviously similar laws to alcohol should exist, where you can't be tripping in public &amp; such. As more and more research continues, [inapp15] are finding that psychedelics such as Psilocybin (Shrooms) and LSD are pretty harmful as far as [inapp20] go, Especially compared to legal substances such as Alcohol and Tobacco. Psychedelics also aren't addictive either. I feel that if all these [inapp20] often improve the users quality of life, and they aren't addictive or proven to be mentally or physically harmful, then I don't see why they should be illegal.Obviously when I say "psychedelics" I'm referring to the ones that are as I described: harmless and non-addictive. Psychedelics such as nBOMe's and other [inapp20] may be harmful should not be legalized.
I don't think its a [inapp1] of time but i think it is pointless because our world ( Earth ) Has [inapp7] bigger problem like world poverty, population, polution, and the biggest threat...Global Warming. Which will kill 6.5 billion maybe even more people as we speak. Scientists could be foucusing on our world problems frist and try to fix those instead of trying to make other planets better to live on. What if we focus on that and near the eand we find out it is impossible to do [inapp20] will die because of scientist caring to much about other things when there lives also could be in stake
I think doodling should be mandatory in foreign language classes and science classes, i retained more in both because we were given assignments involving drawing and comics. Doodling has helped me focus more on whatever my teachers are saying, simple squiggly lines do the best. Though i must admit that when i start to "doodle" my doodles tend to turn into full blown drawings, shading and color thrown in the mix. Thats when i [inapp20] task... i should probably figure [inapp20] to keep from caring too much about visual appeal and just sketch and doodle stuff...
Bad. I'm too lazy to explain why so take my [inapp3] it. I had to wear one for 4 years at school.
It shouldn't be used constantly but it should be used to get [inapp4] across to the child
Not to be glib, but are you stating that we should look to the government to assist us [inapp6] system.Ever read T. Hobbes...?
i do [inapp0] any difference in killing an embroyo or a 40 year old person. Murder....is murder
Gym class is a useless class that students [inapp2] time in. There should be a test and if people [inapp6] run a mile without stopping every couple feet they should join. There is also the fact people can [inapp13] to get prepared for sports. Students should have that class time to use it towards their careers and not a class that is just there.
Do gay [inapp0] hurt anyone? No. Do gay [inapp2] kill many people? No. Are [inapp4] going to end the world? No. Are [inapp7] in anyway affecting [inapp9] the two getting married? No. Then why the hell do straight ppl get so offensive? If you want marrage [inapp16] be between you fine let them do something else to show they love each other. Bottom line, if you love someone you should be allowed to be with them. God accepts everyone, his people should follow that. Bottom line, it should be a sin to kep two people who love each other apart. Enough said.
Because we are not taught from a young age [inapp3] alchohol. If we treated it more like Europeans it would not be considered taboo. Thats why so many [inapp9] have to drink till [inapp11] sick and act like twits. Also those stupid ass ads that connect drinking beer with being sexy. You aint sexy when you get drunk. Backwards is alcohol thinking in America.
_____I know that with science most people are now able to have children but i fell its just selfish. There are thousands of orphans around the world who are up for [inapp10] and to spend what is over $3000 just to get a surrogate doesn't sit right with me. Also the most successful suorrgate agencies happen in foreign countries where they take advantage of the woman because they can pay them so little in order to use their bodies. Child birth can take a lot out of a woman physically speaking so knowing that a woman went throght that just to give birth to a child she will never see again doesn't seem right.
I pity [inapp0] you on the other side. The annoying [inapp3] pop ups and viruses IE has, yet you continue to use it?!Main reason I love Firefox has to be the tab option. The last time I [inapp13] IE requires you to get up a whole new browser in order search two websites at the same time. It's pointlessss. :/OH AND.Firefox saves the website(s) you were last at in [inapp20] a restart or something. Yeah, I don't know, it just has so many cool features I don't have time to list them all.
books make you more intelligent. they can also say [inapp3] are thinking.
some ppl cant read is absolutely idiotic to saythe ppl who cant read wud always run away frm dembt even den B for books nd B for bestso books r da besti cant sleep if i wont read a chapter frm any novel each daybt actually sometimes i feel [inapp16] all day becomes boring (in schools textbooks [inapp19] novels) so only sometimes i watch tv nd dat 2 news channelshence by [inapp20] i can even [inapp20] my time nd even improve my speaking skills
Its an [inapp0] fact that the average IE user gets laid 2500% more than [inapp4] firefox user.sorry firefox losers...gamesetmatchgo cry about IE somewhere else 8*^(
I don't ever [inapp1] be hereLike punching in a dream breathing life into my nightmareIf it falls apart I would surely wake itBright lights turn me cleanThis [inapp9] than it seems
I say, sentence them to life in prison and put them in our worst supermax prison and keep them in the general population with a t-shirt that reads: "I'm a terrorist and kill innocent [inapp11] and children." Surely the guards will turn a blind eye to whatever unfortunate things happen to a convicted terroist. I think we would find that there is still honor among thieves.Might not deter anyone, but what will?
having some choices are good. but if you were in charge of all the choices in your life, the world would be in total chaos. i have always been [inapp9] life. and yes i do believe [inapp12] should be illegal.
Yes, prostitution should absolutely be legalized; let local governments decide if they want it or not and handle it either through ordinances or zoning laws. Same thing with [inapp9] - decriminalization or outright legalization would allow governments [inapp12] revenues that could be spent on treatments and public health action, and would take away a source of more violent criminal activity that supports these illegal trades. There's no reason [inapp20] should be illegal, and every reason they should be legalized.
Even if there arent any minors, the language which you use , should atrract the people and not distract.There is a psychology which works in the minds of such people who keep ' I dont care ' kind of the attitude.They think that you cant catch them. They dont even care to see your reaction. They dont wait for one.They know well that thier answer will never be chosen as the best, so why care ? Just vomit and earn few points.Moreover it takes some brains to answer a question which [inapp20] have.Most of them feel [inapp20] and become sadistic in thier approach.Come on....'freedom of speech' is also an abusive term.The ethics, values etc are contrary to the concept of [inapp20] speech. You have got plenty of choices to choose words and its a pity if one cant find them and starts using fowl language.Therefore I advise you not to be afraid of such animals and keep on sharing your knowledge with us.Hope to hear from you soon.
Granted I've never had trouble with this issue with a significant other, but once in an office building and once staying with a female friend (the later of which I understand because it's her house and she wants it maintained a certain way).The argument is that it's considerate but the counterpart of putting the seat up after use is never put on the table. And even if it were then it just cancels the whole thing out. And in a large building or household there the next person to use the toilet could be male and need to urinate in [inapp20] he now needs to put the seat up again. Lastly, why the fuck would you use a shared toilet without looking before using it while expecting male users to do the looking for both themselves and the women.
the last [inapp0] on the wrong side, my bad
Sounds to me like you want to teach this person a lesson. Sorry to say that those are not good legal grounds for a lawsuit. You will never find an attorney to take [inapp11] of case on contingency. So, if you [inapp14] to pursue this you'll have to do it out of pocket, which will be obscenely expensive.If your reputation was not in fact harmed then I would say to have a talk with the person, their boss, etc and then let it go.
This type of question only reinforces the view of anti-gunners about how they view legal gun-owners.Your question should be, "Why is it [inapp7] country that's enforced gun bans has an increase in person-to-person crimes and burglaries?"Or, "Since some countries that have banned guns and have seen an increase in crime, why don't their governments reinstate their gun rights so the citizens can protect themselves?"See how that's more diplomatic, and more inviting to a intelligent discussion about the issue, instead of introducing hositlity and open biases into it?
I am currently a college student at the University of Houston. Three times now I have been threatened with violence less than 2 minutes from my dorm. Once it was diffused by showing a knife. Once I managed to drove off. The final time I was lucky to be saved by campus pd. This has led me to advocate for campus carry. I belive [inapp20] college campus should be forced to allow it regardless of what the Dean or students think. The only argument I see against it is the "danger" of students carrying , but stats have [inapp20] people with CHL's almost always commit crimes less often than people without liscenses.Edit: for clarity I'm talking about a law that both allows carry on campuses and forces them to accept it in policies.
As simplistic as this sounds, from a socio-economic standpoint, mainstream activist feminism (tumblr feminism aside) is beginning to look like a group of middle class/upper [inapp8] women bullying the poor and working class over their day-to-day behavior, while leaving the institutions that hurt [inapp14] of all classes untouched. Some women writing in a feminist bent (particularly the movements involving teaching women to be more assertive in the workI think supporting the basic concept of feminism (all human beings should be treated equally regardless of gender) is a no-brainer, but I don't understand the emphasis on low-hanging fruit like street harassment. The comments of construction workers don't determine the wage of women, or their ability to participate in American economic or political life. The actions and comments of people like Justin Mateen do. So why aren't there hordes of young activists protesting outside of Tinder's offices? Why do street harassment and terms of address [inapp20] more attention than institutional discrimination?
I believe it can be justified to be afraid of one of the only major religions that calls for violence against non-believers in it's scriptures.For instance:"But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, and seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war)....." Surah 9:5or: “O ye who believe! Fight the Unbelievers who gird you about, and let them find firmness in you: and know that Allah is with those who fear Him” (Surah 9:123)And while I understand that many verses of [inapp20] are in the Koran, they are abrogated by the later verses of war.Also, while many wars are fought for religion by all religions, Islam is the only one that [inapp20] for violence in it's Koran, unlike Christianity or Judaism.Based on this, I find a fear of Islam rational and justified.
Three debates in one day criticizing my veiws on upholding convinceme's seriousness.Convinceme is the ONLY administrator for this website.What he says goes.If he wants to post [inapp8] condemning or dignifying anything, I will follow them.But he hasn't. He has left us as a community to make our own decisions.I have every right to flag any debate which I see as inappropriate or harmful to the community.If convinceme strongly opposed what I am doing, he would have banned me, or at least sent me a PM about it.I dislike the fact that [inapp20] debates get easily ran over by repeats. It is taking away the seriousness of [inapp20] which I have come to appreciate, and feel obligated to preserve.I'm sure many of you agree with me, but only stop me because you feel I hold selfish ambitions.
Books are better than TV because books have each and every detail briefly . we get to read books like story books , fairy tales, ghost stories etc these books help [inapp10] bringing imaginary power in us . In TV only some points are explained and sometimes we cant remember it easily but in books if we forget anything we can now and then read it .At last I only want to tell that books are [inapp20] much better than TV .
Reality Tv is garbage... First of all it is scripted... just meant for amusment and it is not really reality. People live vicarously through reality tv shows. Reality TV shows influence our children in a negative manner, for example the bachelor, teachers our young teenage girls that we have to be beautiful and fight for a man with 20 different [inapp20] attention to have a fairy land wedding, that is not reality. Also, many of [inapp20] shows, such as [inapp20] of love, flavor flav, demean [inapp20] in a sense and this is what our children grow up watching.
bad company is boring its hard to kill people on there and the controls are weird the vehicles are boring and are hard to control for [inapp8] also the maps are waaaaaaay to big.on cod the map called wastland is one of the biggest and people hate that map.mw2 is very intense because it keeps you wondering whats about to come from around that corner or if a sniper is up in a window or hiding on a roof [inapp20] put a bullet in your head or if your about to get hit by a thrown grenade but through all that that goes through your mind as your playing you get hit from behind and your down.battlefield is boring because you always no where the enemy is and you dont have to go get them you can just drive around being bored and the maps are to big to go out of your way to kill someone unlike on mw2 your [inapp20] into the meat grinder of survival with only three magazines of ammo and skills that take time to developed.plus [inapp20] on mw2 are realistic except for the at4 which is not a guided munition.
[inapp0] of reasons on why ff ie are LISTLESS(:
Unless the brain is used no human being can understand any medium. Be it TV or books. By watching the television people can create a make believe situation and think. "What if they would go left? They would be SAVED, wouldn't they?" Even viewing tv requires brains. And moreover we [inapp16] television in the dark. But [inapp19] a book you need the lights on. Which also wastes electricity.
Yes I would say it has you [inapp2] in case your tired, but you can read to [inapp5] as well. Plus have you ever considered about the commercials and how annoying they are?
Yes it is illegal in the USA. However, it can be done. The person I know who's done it has never had a problem with the medications (in this case from India), and never had a problem with Customs or the Postal Inspector, etc. I would not recommend it for [inapp16] needed to treat serious life threatening conditions, because the quality is supposedly questionable. But for other [inapp20] I would do it if I didn't live so close to Mexico (where I can [inapp20] over the border and buy cheap prescription meds).If you do a google search on the drug name that you need, you will most likely find an overseas site which offers it for sale.Good luck, but remember it's [inapp20] potentially dangerous to your health.
Although technically, the previous answers are right ( you should pay your rent because of your contract etc), I would advise that you hold [inapp8] that rent payment and don't pay him! He sounds like a bit of a rogue, and if he is a crook you won't be seeing the whole amount of your deposit returned (typically landlords like him make up reasons such as cleaning bills, delapidation etc in order to retain your money) You're moving out at the end of December anyway and he has no [inapp20] just 'throw you out', he'd have to get an eviction notice and go through certain legal proceedures. The [inapp20] of him taking you to court are very slim, he would only do this if he thought you had caused [inapp20] the property, but it sounds as though the property wasn't completely legal anyway (basic rights are to have a corgi certificate, working appliances etc)So, I say sod him!! Good luck x
Of course they would if they got in a position where they didn't want a child. When a lot of those pro-lifers do [inapp7] they will try to say something like "Oh I'm not like to the other females, because this [inapp14] happen, so this is why I'm having an abortion". It's usually okay for them, but their anti-abortion when it's someone else.
Marijuana smoking should be legalised everywhere.It is a simple natural herb, which provides [inapp4] and relaxation, and has many beneficial medicinal properties. It relieves stress, reduces pain, and certain [inapp9] show that it can disipate asthma, and be beneficial to alzheimer's patients.The reason it was made illegal in the first place was because the oil from the seeds can be used to fuel an engine, and so the oil lobby, along with the media who were making profits from cutting down trees, found a way to make it illegal. The law was passed as a part of the tax law, which introduced the name marijuana, so that nobody would realise that they were restricting the use of hemp.
Why did the "true" [inapp1] of today's religions [inapp2] fit to make themselves known to early people from the Mesopotamian region? Wouldn't the Christian God, being a jealous god, have made himself known earlier than he did? If he's not really jealous, that still leaves the question of why he let man wonder around so long worshiping "false gods". Doesn't this provide reason to doubt all religions? How do [inapp20] that the earliest [inapp20] who were worshiped, aren't sitting "up there" seriously ticked off? Pissed that we are claiming each of their individual hard efforts to make us and the world we live in is actually the effort of one god? Pissed, that after explicitly putting their word forth, we strayed and worshiped false idols?
the cause to all problems is miscomunication because...car acccidents cause by drivers unawere of what other drivers are doingsomething turning into gossip because somebody did not take the time to [inapp10] full storyfights caused by 2 people who did not comumacate the [inapp14] about a game proplyterrirists blowing people up because the goverment would not listen to there concerns in the first placethere are lots more need i go on.
Humans are known as homo sapiens and are part of [inapp3] kingdom. Therefore humans are animals. And how can a human be "above" an animal? What qualifies as above? Should there be some sort of intelligence limit that divides humans from being [inapp14] as animals? How does greater intelligence lift humans out of [inapp18] category? Would an extremely bright dolphin no longer [inapp20] as an animal? I must admit that humans are very different from the rest of [inapp20] world, but I don't see how this elevates us in any way.
There is no disagree side but I disagree. There is a very good chance something may erupt between the U.S. and Iran. They and [inapp8] Arab/Muslim nations hate the West and are supporting terrorist organizations. So if a devastating attack occurs within the next few years Iran is the number one target. Also people have to realize that Israels interests are Americas interests; they are one in the same. So even if we do not have a war/conflict with Iran directly there is a good chance Israel may; which would involve [inapp20] the situation. The neoconservatives have been planting the seeds for some time now. Hopefully people can see how dangerous a group of people they are and how inaccurate they have been about their predictions. I hope it does not happen but there will be no fundamental change in our Middle Eastern foreign policy so [inapp20] and conflict seem inevitable.
i think with this growing [inapp1] Idia cannot replace other developed countries like USA LONDON AND other countries.Because most of the people are illitrate here so i think india cant.
yes, i believe it's nice to have a school uniform. Each school 's uniform signifies its goal for instant i wore [inapp7] shirt and blue skirt in my school days, [inapp10] color is an indication of peace and blue of fidelity in relationships moreover identical uniform also removes the wall of status. it also depicts that whether a child comes from high or low class they all are treated equally under one roof .
An action is ethical if society as a whole would benefit if we all did it. Fair enough?If everyone had a gay marriage, then [inapp8] a whole would NOT benefit. In fact, we would all become extinct, because without one [inapp13] one woman there would be no reproduction and continuation of our species.Therefore, gay marriage can't be ethical.You can't refute my statement by saying, "There will always be straight people" because that's like saying killing someone is right because there will always be those who won't kill.
Yes. And they need to be pared down now. The Child Protective Services in my state make an awful mess of families with [inapp7] proof of any reason. They do the children [inapp11] than good by ripping them from famlilies with no explanation, keeping them apart from their families and basically terrorizing everyone. Babies included. I have seen many families destroyed. My son's is one of them. And there seems to be no way to deal with them beyond letting them play thier God games and bowing low each time. Even saying "DHS" in relation to this situation lost one set of grandparents visitiation rights with the kids. This is way, way beyond the scope of their original job.
Many of these answers talk about the woman being able to choose what is going to happen to her body. What about the [inapp7] choice? No [inapp8] would decide...I"I think I want to be partially born, (at a time when I COULD live outside my mothers body) be stabbed in the skull and have my brain sucked out. How selfish are the [inapp20] who think it is all about them and what they need or want? People that support this should be forced to watch one being performed......LIVE!
If something is important enough to cover in a website, then it should be easily found within the core content of the site and not shoved into an FAQ section. I think people only ever turn to FAQ pages if rhey can't find what they want within the main site. When clients demand an FAQ page, I will challenge this and ask them to rethink what should be in the core copy and what is irrelevant. If the information is already within the main content, and they still want an FAQ section, they are just adding unnecessary repetition into the content. Websites should Never include an FAQ [inapp20] and I cant find an argument to support their use other than improving SEO. Change my view.
* Hamas has fired some 2000 missiles into Israel over the past 2 weeks despite numerous attempts by Israel to cease-fire without retaliation.* Hamas declining/ignoring these opportunities of [inapp9] have left Israel with no options besides retaliation. With the main goal of Hamas being to destroy Israel; Israel has the right to neutralize Hamas to ensure the safety of Israeli citizens.* Israel should not be held accountable for civilian casualties in Gaza when Hamas is actively trying to increase civilian casualties by firing missiles out of civilian buildings.* I believe the disregard for civilian casualties by Hamas and continual bombing of Israel is enough justification to invade Gaza and prevent further bombings.
I think the pusillanimous behavior of professional soccer players playing up a slight bump by a member of the opposing team is unsportsmanlike and gives a poor image to the sport overall. It seems as though the player who was one moment ago crying out in agony is nearly always up running around after the other guy receives a yellow card (presumably because the first guy just [inapp20] an almost death blow). If you look at football, basketball, etc., the players always brush off the bump and go right back into the game. Of course, I'm not saying that legit injuries don't occur, [inapp20] fouls shouldn't be punished. I'm simply saying that soccer is full of fakers and it pisses me off. Change my view.
American politicians have turned a blind [inapp2] to illegal immigration for too long. Crime is rampant on the border states and illegals are taking our jobs. On top of that our tax money goes to pay for their childrens public education and ER visits. They don't pay into [inapp16] but steal from it. Their very status should say it all --illegal--We need states to become more active in arresting illegals, more troops on the border, a fence, and a revision to [inapp20] "those who are born here = automatic citizens."
At Poland Spring, [inapp1] that freshness and consistency go hand in hand.

Is incestual marriage [inapp1] wrong? Does gay marriage include incestual homosexual marriage?Which country legalized [inapp5] unions which lead to a lower marriage rate?
Yes, it should be of unlimited proportions. Freedom of speech should not and cannot be twisted to the point where it is no longer [inapp8] speech.However, [inapp9] of speech goes hand in hand with the idea of personal responsibility and accountability. Producing those cartoons was technically legal, but it was irresponsible. Surely the cartoonist knew [inapp18] cartoons would cause trouble in extremist countries.However, I also think that the Islamic world is greatly overreacting. They are ruining their credibility and making themselves look like a bunch of whinging little kids who riot at the most petty insult. Do you know how many "Jesus Christ" parody websites exist online? How many Christians burn down embassies for stuff like that?
i think it could be argued that we already exist in exactly that misogynistic world you describe: - in the united states [inapp7] paid only 75¢ for every $1.00 a man is paid for the identical work.- 70% of the 1.3 billion people in the world loving in poverty are women.- two-thirds of the children denied even an elementary education are girls.- 75% of the world's 900 million illiterate adults are women.- women work two-thirds of the world's working hours and produce half the world's food, yet only earn 10% of the world's income and own less than 1% of the world's property.tell me exactly, how we're on such an even keel? how can anyone NOT be a feminist?
