The only other choices are, adoption or keep it.And I know many children get adopted but many don'tand it might be better off to just have an abortion tolet them suffer.That's the chance they take, I guess. But who are we todecide one womans pregnancy.
Who are we to judge what is right or wrong? Can we not just let people make decisions and live with the consequences?
I am an American, and I am ashamed to admit "Merica is rich due to slavery. India never had slavery and used to be rich until the British came and took everything away. We were left in a bad state, but started developing quickly. India is much more competitive in education than America and soon when everyone has education (which will happen in our lifetime) India will excel.India has the potential.
All my life I've grown up around religious people, always telling me abortion was wrong, murder, and immoral. But I slowly realized, it's not really a fully formed human, how could it be murder? This never made any sense, it's someone's body, if they want to abort a pregnancy, let them. Don't shame them into having a baby based on religious views. Anyway, I'm rambling, but I'm interested to see other views on this, so go ahead and try to change my view. If it matters, I'm Christian, 16, and male.
Well, I hate to be a downer, guys, but I don't think humanity has another 100 years left (give or take a few years). I want to believe that things will be alright, but when you keep hearing worse and worse news about the environmental degradation of the planet (even if you are still somehow a climate-change denier, you have to admit the oceans are massively polluted and huge amounts of fish are dying, the air in some parts of the world like China is almost unbreathable and getting worse, etc.), it's hard to see humans coming out of this ok. I hate to say it, but I don't think we have another century left. Please tell me why I'm wrong.Edit: Just to be clear, I'm not talking about human extinction. We'll probably survive whatever happens to some degree. I mean I think that society will likely collapse. Humans may still be around, but in a Mad Max/The Road/Book of Eli type of existence.
I have a strong opinion that before having children, the prospective parents should have to pass a series of background and IQ tests.Kids being brought into this world need a good foundation to start a successful life with. You may have that limited case where the parents are morons and the kids strive to be different then their failure parents, but in most cases it is an endless line of parasites on our world.We need more smart people.
with the cream layer quota system i don't prefer india to be leading the world in near future.....yes india have the potential.. but corruption , this quota system ( not helpful to anyone) , and the main reason brain drain , don't specialy help india in the matter....
Sorry, one more thing:I think it's interesting that SINGTHESTORY and SIBTIGER haven't responded to my explanation of WHY I find adoption a less than desirable alternative to abortion....Funny how people just IGNORE what they can't or don't want to argue against.If you're going to write a rebuttal to someone's argument on here, then click "view all" first. This gives you a history of their arguments and it may help to eliminate the need for that person to REPEAT themselves by addressing something they've already addressed.
A women and she alone is the one who should determine if she wants an abortion or not, at any stage of her pregnancy. Why is that it is mostly older white men who are attempting to establish anti-abortion laws for women? Why is it that most anit-abortionists are pro-death penalty?Jon Jax 71
You lost me--- 99% of what you say speaks IN FAVOR of evolution and AGAINST creationism--- At most you point out that science doesn't have all the answers (no scientist would try to counter you on that one) and that there may easily be halfway point between faith/science where evolution and creationism can co-exist (a great many liberal theologians and even agnostics would have no real problem with that idea)
What i dont undertsand is how people rationalize taking life it just doesnt make any sense... idc the situation in america how is killing leagal?
You know I really don't see why not? After all people in Europe are allowed to drink at the age of 16-Germany---and in Mexico the drinking age was 18 until now that it's 21. I think the reason why it's 21 is because people in the US are too freaking retarded and dont' know how to act right. Why in foreign countries the drinking age is lower and they actually have less accidents or anyother problems? Think about that!
Towed three times and impounded for 30 days each time?  Man, you're just not getting the message, are you?If you are in California, you bet the police can forfeit your vehicle and it doesn't take three times to make it a charm.  Technically, your vehicle could be subject to forfeiture proceedings after your first suspended license beef.  Someone like you is exactly the reason the legislature designed that law, because your privilege to drive has been taken away from you and yet you obviously continue to drive.  People like you are involved in an exponentially higher than average number of traffic accidents so the legislature figured maybe people like you should have your vehicles forfeited to the state if you just didn't go along with the game plan.Voila - I give you California Vehicle Code section 14607.6...and a link to it below.  It would also be worth your time to review 14607.4, whether or not you live in California.You really need to stop driving.  Really.
It's a lottery - luck of the draw.It will decide a winner, to be sure.But the better team doesn't always win. And truthfully shoot outs are exciting as anything any other sport can produce but it's a lazy and unfair way to decide a game, especially at the level of the World Cup.The standard argument is that if 90 minutes in regulation time and 30 more in over time doesn't produce a winner another 30 (or more) won't either.Why not?How about removing players from each side as more and more overtime is played or allow more substitutes during OT?There are many other options that can be used besides shoot outs but everyone seems to be ok with this style of game play.It is an unfair, and truthfully a sissy way to decide something so important.CMV
our waiter was fine.  very polite and attentive.  that was the best part of the meal!!!  that's sad!so disappointed in the food here!  absolutely horrible lasagna.  might be the worst i've ever had (maybe chef boyardee is worse - MAYBE!!!)do not go here to eat.  so many better places in LV!  absolutely bland and boring food.  calamari was just meh.  the meatballs were ok but kind of bland.DO NOT EAT HERE! cannot stress that enough.  unless you want to overpay for bad food. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!
As humans, we cannot know exactly if there is a higher force or not. Christianity however is not it. Firstly because it is not one belief that every Christian shares, it lacks solidarity. I compare it to a road with all different kinds of sideways. Ask a question about religion, and lots of people will find one of those sideways to adjust their religion to their personal beliefs.With Atheïsm, the concept is pretty clear. It is more scientific, and I like that.
Ethically, it's not okay for anyone to invade the privacy of an innocent person.  It's stupid and potentially dangerous to stalk celebrities, and many suits have been brought against various photographers and publications.  However, we have the right to know what the government is doing-- because it's with our money.  Governments steal from us, then use the fruits of their theft against us.Anyone arguing that the 4th Amendment protects our privacy from the government is living under a rock.  The 4th has been effectively nullified by SSNs, gun records, increasing search & seizure to look for a "probable cause", phone tapping, and the fact that the government is so vast and powerful that businesses are being forced to collude with bureaucrats and hand over what little privacy we had left.
They don't do that. It's a hollywood thing. I've been to court many times (to observe, not as a witness or anything) and I've never seen them do that. They only ask you to raise your right hand and say "I swear the statement I am about to give is the truth." Or something similar. That's all.
I feel like Physical education should be mandatory because people need there exercise. If they don't get physical activity they wont burn as much fats as they accumulate thus will get chubbier. They should be stricter during those classes of Physical education because a lot of the time people mostly just stand around. I don't want to seem sexist, but the ones that get the least exercise are the girls and they just mostly stand there and socialize. They need a way to keep everyone active, people need to get moving! They need this for there health!
of cz phys ed must be taught but mustn"t b compulsory coz sme of us are not fit 2 du the extensive exersises perfomed
Simply WrittenSeeking to advance the Common goodallows doors to be opened and barriers to bebroken, and after a journey (or) series ofconsiderate acts one can have an less-difficulttime Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle.The word for this debate is[sacrifice]How much would a person really "sacrifice"for his or her neighbor without beingblinded by the light beemed from selfishness??No matter where a person is in thier life....Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did(or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!
If you are with your children, supervising them, then you wouldn't need a registry to do it for you. It is your responsibility as a parent to supervise your children at all times. If you will look at the horrendous crimes against children, they are children that were not being supervised by a parent. Also, 90 to 95% of sex offenses occur by someone known to the child within the family or close friends. Stranger danger is not all that prevalent and the registries do nothing but provide a false sense of security.
People always talk about how unfair it is to discriminate against people, but I see tons of discrimination and hatred against the rich (especially on reddit). I think this discrimination is just as morally wrong as all other forms of discrimination.  America is always talked about as a free society and a land of equality, but how free and equal can it be if it charges certain people more for being more productive?!?!  Additional taxes and discrimination on the productive also serve the effect of discouraging this behavior (or encouraging it to happen elsewhere where Americans don't benefit from spillover effects), and our subsidy system for poor people (especially regarding reproduction) has grown the ranks of the poor by millions.
Being horny is a sin.Wanking is a sinHaving sex with your girlfriend is a sinRaping is a sinIf this is what young men are taught, how can they have an concept of what wrong and right actually are. We should teach morals not religion.Religion teaches natural feelings are wrong. You don't tell a woman feeling cold is wrong so why tell a man acting on hornyness is wrong? I'm not say rape is right just that consential sex with a girlfirend is not wrong and putting the two in the same context of a 'sin' is causing rape.
my friend is, in my opinion, being stupid. she is gonna move to texas to a place where she will be in the minority. 13% of the entire town is white. mostly gang territory. not far from the mexican border. leaveing everything behind, includeing family and friends. most people tell her to stay. What do you think?
Well I definitely would stick by my vows of marriage through the good times and the bad but I mean some people get married without truly knowing who the person is. Hmmm that is a hard one. Well if I truly loved this person I would not turn them in because, I mean I made a promise to them that they could turn to me for help in thick and thin till death do us part. But there are divorces that happen all the time because for whatever reason, but I don't know this is a toughy.
I would support the fact of being fatherless then having a lousy father. Fathers most likely are supposed to be the provider for the household and solve the problems that comes in hand because his like the alpha male but if your lousy then what point is it for you to have around. Kids look towards their father as an example of how to be a man and to have responsibility's over the actions they make. so why not be fatherless when having a lousy father is the same thing.
I think it's better to have a lousy father then fatherless, because a father just being in the childs life has a huge impact on the child. Without a father, the child will not feel secure in a certain sense. Of course, mothers give that feeling, but fathers give it in another way. A girl for example, girls who have fathers are less careless then girls without. To me, I see girl's who don't have fathers grow up a hard life. Boys, they probably feel like they have to take on the fatherly responsiblity as they get older. Which shouldn't be the case.
We already have this, it is called the Social Security Card.Every employer can call the SSA and verify the information of a given social security number.  Our government has just made it so difficult to do this that most employers will not take the time.When you are hired for a job, you are supposed to provide I-9 documentation.  You can use a passport, or state issued id & social security card (not just number), or birth certificate & ss card, etc.  There are already laws and fines in place regarding improperly documenting your workers.  The problem is our elected officials would rather waste our money & time by presenting completely new regulations (justifying their jobs) instead of making the appropriate government administration enforce the laws we already have.Politicians are becoming better and better at doing nothing but creating redundent worthless laws.  And we keep re-electing them.So I would NOT vote for this ridiculous limit on my freedom and waste of the American taxpayers' monies.
I haven't followed this political case, but I believe that any law named after a person is questionable since those pusing it will often be reacting based on emotion and grief, rather than reason.Any good law will have safeguards, and rational provisions so that whatever action is made illegal is really the action that is the threat. I generally oppose laws that make actions illegal just because they might, in combination with other actions, have the potential to cause harm. I believe in punishing those who cause the harm, and not limiting action based purely on speculation.That being said, the voting process has become an emotional one. People -- whether voters or legislators -- pass laws based on their gut reactions, often without any concern for the consequences or long term effects. Logic and reason have largely been abandoned in favor of making headlines.And sadly, that's not likely to change any time soon. Good luck.
If 1/2 the schools in the US thinks yes, then teachers are not doing well in the history aspect of education. Now, these kids need to know their rights, and the rights of others. I thought schools get taught the Constitution and bill of rights. At least I would expect thee civil war to be mentioned before 6th grade, the rest would follow. Freedom of speech, FREEDOM OF PRESS, freedom of religion, and so on. With this knowledge one can understand why America is America and not new great Brittan or some British ruled country paying taxes on land we are not living and harvesting from. ( ha, nowadays, this country is doing all kinds of illegal activities. No wonder why 1/2 the youth is lost and confused)
Basically I am asserting since the storm-cloaks are painted as the complete villain out of the two choices their( the storm-cloaks and the empires war) is a weaker section of the skyrim story. Let's break down why the storm-cloaks are bad. They are racist they abuse and mistreat those different from them this makes them evil by today's morales and paints them( the storm-cloaks) as the villains and Ulfric as the mastermind. Secondly Ulfric used thu'um to kill the high king, basically he invoked an ancient and powerful gift to kill another bad guy deed. This is what makes the storm-cloaks the obvious bad guys they have nothing that paints them as good in any way except for not being the one to want to cut your head of at the beginning. Try to CMV by proving to me the storm-cloaks aren't just Saturday morning cartoon villains.
syona if look at glance, then most of us are unable to specify any solid solutions by which we can remove the hurdle in our progress from root.we all are very much aware of problems but unable to give solutions.they are criticizing government,terrorism and so on.no one realizes that being a citizen what is our duty?everyone should understand abt. their importance and role for country.Because a good citizen,a criminal,terrorist,corrupted politician, everyone is human, then why a human is creating problem for another human.I hope you will think my views and reply me soon.
Raffles unjustly removed Farquhar from his position in Singapore and accused him of ' being too close to the local population '. I think that it is unfair that a person who contributed so much to Singapore's development be unjustly sent off like that.
i LIKE porn, jerking off is always a good time
tv is better than books because you learn easier by seeing not read
I feel that people should have the right to explore their own consciousness as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else in the process. Obviously similar laws to alcohol should exist, where you can't be tripping in public &amp; such. As more and more research continues, scientists are finding that psychedelics such as Psilocybin (Shrooms) and LSD are pretty harmful as far as drugs go, Especially compared to legal substances such as Alcohol and Tobacco. Psychedelics also aren't addictive either. I feel that if all these drugs do is often improve the users quality of life, and they aren't addictive or proven to be mentally or physically harmful, then I don't see why they should be illegal.Obviously when I say "psychedelics" I'm referring to the ones that are as I described: harmless and non-addictive. Psychedelics such as nBOMe's and other ones that may be harmful should not be legalized.
I don't think its a waste of time but i think it is pointless because our world ( Earth ) Has its own bigger problem like world poverty, population, polution, and the biggest threat...Global Warming. Which will kill 6.5 billion maybe even more people as we speak. Scientists could be foucusing on our world problems frist and try to fix those instead of trying to make other planets better to live on. What if we focus on that and near the eand we find out it is impossible to do and everyone will die because of scientist caring to much about other things when there lives also could be in stake
I think doodling should be mandatory in foreign language classes and science classes, i retained more in both because we were given assignments involving drawing and comics. Doodling has helped me focus more on whatever my teachers are saying, simple squiggly lines do the best. Though i must admit that when i start to "doodle" my doodles tend to turn into full blown drawings, shading and color thrown in the mix. Thats when i get off task... i should probably figure out how to keep from caring too much about visual appeal and just sketch and doodle stuff...
Bad. I'm too lazy to explain why so take my word for it. I had to wear one for 4 years at school.
It shouldn't be used constantly but it should be used to get the message across to the child
Not to be glib, but are you stating that we should look to the government to assist us with our belief system.Ever read T. Hobbes...?
i do not see any difference in killing an embroyo or a 40 year old person. Murder....is murder
Gym class is a useless class that students waste time in. There should be a test and if people can not run a mile without stopping every couple feet they should join. There is also the fact people can join to get prepared for sports. Students should have that class time to use it towards their careers and not a class that is just there.
Do gay marriages hurt anyone? No. Do gay marriages kill many people? No. Are gay marriages going to end the world? No. Are gay marriages in anyway affecting anyone but the two getting married? No. Then why the hell do straight ppl get so offensive? If you want marrage to just be between you fine let them do something else to show they love each other. Bottom line, if you love someone you should be allowed to be with them. God accepts everyone, his people should follow that. Bottom line, it should be a sin to kep two people who love each other apart. Enough said.
Because we are not taught from a young age to respect alchohol. If we treated it more like Europeans it would not be considered taboo. Thats why so many teenagers have to drink till they get sick and act like twits. Also those stupid ass ads that connect drinking beer with being sexy. You aint sexy when you get drunk. Backwards is alcohol thinking in America.
_____I know that with science most people are now able to have children but i fell its just selfish. There are thousands of orphans around the world who are up for adoption and to spend what is over $3000 just to get a surrogate doesn't sit right with me. Also the most successful suorrgate agencies happen in foreign countries where they take advantage of the woman because they can pay them so little in order to use their bodies. Child birth can take a lot out of a woman physically speaking so knowing that a woman went throght that just to give birth to a child she will never see again doesn't seem right.
I pity those of you on the other side. The annoying load of pop ups and viruses IE has, yet you continue to use it?!Main reason I love Firefox has to be the tab option. The last time I checked IE requires you to get up a whole new browser in order search two websites at the same time. It's pointlessss. :/OH AND.Firefox saves the website(s) you were last at in case of a restart or something. Yeah, I don't know, it just has so many cool features I don't have time to list them all.
books make you more intelligent. they can also say what people are thinking.
some ppl cant read is absolutely idiotic to saythe ppl who cant read wud always run away frm dembt even den B for books nd B for bestso books r da besti cant sleep if i wont read a chapter frm any novel each daybt actually sometimes i feel reading books all day becomes boring (in schools textbooks nd at home novels) so only sometimes i watch tv nd dat 2 news channelshence by reading books i can even pass my time nd even improve my speaking skills
Its an indisputable fact that the average IE user gets laid 2500% more than the average firefox user.sorry firefox losers...gamesetmatchgo cry about IE somewhere else 8*^(
I don't ever wanna be hereLike punching in a dream breathing life into my nightmareIf it falls apart I would surely wake itBright lights turn me cleanThis is worse than it seems
I say, sentence them to life in prison and put them in our worst supermax prison and keep them in the general population with a t-shirt that reads: "I'm a terrorist and kill innocent women and children." Surely the guards will turn a blind eye to whatever unfortunate things happen to a convicted terroist.  I think we would find that there is still honor among thieves.Might not deter anyone, but what will?
You can watch TV in one sitting where as a book takes all day to read. So no physical exercise will get done reading books. Exercise shows on TV make you move. SO TV IS WAY BETTER THEN BOOKS!!!!!!!
having some choices are good. but if you were in charge of all the choices in your life, the world would be in total chaos. i have always been pro life. and yes i do believe abortions should be illegal.
Yes, prostitution should absolutely be legalized; let local governments decide if they want it or not and handle it either through ordinances or zoning laws.  Same thing with drugs - decriminalization or outright legalization would allow governments to raise revenues that could be spent on treatments and public health action, and would take away a source of more violent criminal activity that supports these illegal trades.  There's no reason these things should be illegal, and every reason they should be legalized.
Even if there arent any minors, the language which you use , should atrract the people and not distract.There is a psychology which works in the minds of such people who keep ' I dont care ' kind of the attitude.They think that you cant catch them. They dont even care to see your reaction. They dont wait for  one.They know well that thier answer will never be chosen as the best, so why care ? Just vomit and earn few points.Moreover it takes some brains to answer a question which they dont have.Most of them feel pleasure and become sadistic in thier approach.Come on....'freedom of speech' is also an abusive term.The ethics, values etc are contrary to the concept of freedom of speech. You have got plenty of choices to choose words and its a pity if one cant find them and starts using fowl language.Therefore I advise you not to be afraid of such animals and keep on sharing your knowledge with us.Hope to hear from you soon.
Granted I've never had trouble with this issue with a significant other, but once in an office building and once staying with a female friend (the later of which I understand because it's her house and she wants it maintained a certain way).The argument is that it's considerate but the counterpart of putting the seat up after use is never put on the table. And even if it were then it just cancels the whole thing out. And in a large building or household there the next person to use the toilet could be male and need to urinate in which case he now needs to put the seat up again. Lastly, why the fuck would you use a shared toilet without looking before using it while expecting male users to do the looking for both themselves and the women.
THIS PLACE NOT ONLY HAS NASTY ASS BURGERS BUT THE SERVICE IS HORRIBLE!  After i orderded people were waiting for over 40 minutes and there plane was boarding so they started yelling into the kitchen "JUST GIVE ME WHAT U GOT!" PUAHAHHAA  thats when i relized i should of went elsewhere...I ordered the ruby burger i realized i may have missed ordered cause i realized there was no cheese with this burger, but come on plz put some mayo on my burger and dont over cook  my paddy!  I felt like i was eating a card board burger! SOOO nasty i only ate most of it cause i paid for it and i was hungry.  Fries were fries nothing special....Wanted to go to burger king originally but the gate was closed to go there!NEVER GOIN HERE AGAIN!
I think that advancing the common good is better because its helping out the community. But personal pursuit will be better because i know that if i dont go to college after high school then i wont go at all so i would choose my personal pursuit.
Sounds to me like you want to teach this person a lesson. Sorry to say that those are not good legal grounds for a lawsuit.  You will never find an attorney to take this kind of case on contingency.  So, if you really want to pursue this you'll have to do it out of pocket, which will be obscenely expensive.If your reputation was not in fact harmed then I would say to have a talk with the person, their boss, etc and then let it go.
This type of question only reinforces the view of anti-gunners about how they view legal gun-owners.Your question should be, "Why is it that every country that's enforced gun bans has an increase in person-to-person crimes and burglaries?"Or, "Since some countries that have banned guns and have seen an increase in crime, why don't their governments reinstate their gun rights so the citizens can protect themselves?"See how that's more diplomatic, and more inviting to a intelligent discussion about the issue, instead of introducing hositlity and open biases into it?
I am currently a college student at the University of Houston. Three times now I have been threatened with violence less than 2 minutes from my dorm. Once it was diffused by showing a knife. Once I managed to drove off. The final time I was lucky to be saved by campus pd. This has led me to advocate for campus carry. I belive that every college campus should be forced to allow it regardless of what the Dean or students think. The only argument I see against it is the "danger" of students carrying , but stats have proven that people with CHL's almost always commit crimes less often than people without liscenses.Edit: for clarity I'm talking about a law that both allows carry on campuses and forces them to accept it in policies.
As simplistic as this sounds, from a socio-economic standpoint, mainstream activist feminism (tumblr feminism aside) is beginning to look like a group of middle class/upper middle class women bullying the poor and working class over their day-to-day behavior, while leaving the institutions that hurt women of all classes untouched.  Some women writing in a feminist bent (particularly the movements involving teaching women to be more assertive in the workI think supporting the basic concept of feminism (all human beings should be treated equally regardless of gender) is a no-brainer, but I don't understand the emphasis on low-hanging fruit like street harassment. The comments of construction workers don't determine the wage of women, or their ability to participate in American economic or political life. The actions and comments of people like Justin Mateen do. So why aren't there hordes of young activists protesting outside of Tinder's offices? Why do street harassment and terms of address merit more attention than institutional discrimination?
Three debates in one day criticizing my veiws on upholding convinceme's seriousness.Convinceme is the ONLY administrator for this website.What he says goes.If he wants to post rules condemning or dignifying anything, I will follow them.But he hasn't. He has left us as a community to make our own decisions.I have every right to flag any debate which I see as inappropriate or harmful to the community.If convinceme strongly opposed what I am doing, he would have banned me, or at least sent me a PM about it.I dislike the fact that intelligent debates get easily ran over by repeats. It is taking away the seriousness of this website which I have come to appreciate, and feel obligated to preserve.I'm sure many of you agree with me, but only stop me because you feel I hold selfish ambitions.
Books are better than TV because books have each and every detail briefly . we get to read books like story books , fairy tales, ghost stories etc these books help us in bringing imaginary power in us . In TV only some points are explained and sometimes we cant remember it easily but in books if we forget anything we can now and then read it .At last I only want to tell that books are much and much better than TV .
Oh my, you are either very young or new to this country.If you have money or you are famous, you can buy whatever judgement or law that you want enacted.If you are poor then you are just out of luck.  Lawyers will not take your case unless it means very big money for them. Even if you are totally in the right unless they can make a huge profit they will not touch it.So, repeat after me.  Money equals privilage under the law.Poverty equals nothing.Save yourself a lot of time and learn it now.
Reality Tv is garbage... First of all it is scripted... just meant for amusment and it is not really reality. People live vicarously through reality tv shows. Reality TV shows influence our children in a negative manner, for example the bachelor, teachers our young teenage girls that we have to be beautiful and fight for a man with 20 different women to get their attention to have a fairy land wedding, that is not reality. Also, many of the reality shows, such as rock of love, flavor flav, demean women in a sense and this is what our children grow up watching.
bad company is boring its hard to kill people on there and the controls are weird the vehicles are boring and are hard to control for some reason also the maps are waaaaaaay to big.on cod the map called wastland is one of the biggest and people hate that map.mw2 is very intense because it keeps you wondering whats about to come from around that corner or if a sniper is up in a window or hiding on a roof ready to put a bullet in your head or if your about to get hit by a thrown grenade but through all that that goes through your mind as your playing you get hit from behind and your down.battlefield is boring because you always no where the enemy is and you dont have to go get them you can just drive around being bored and the maps are to big to go out of your way to kill someone unlike on mw2 your thrown into the meat grinder of survival with only three magazines of ammo and skills that take time to developed.plus weapons on mw2 are realistic except for the at4 which is not a guided munition.
Unless the brain is used no human being can understand any medium. Be it TV or books. By watching the television people can create a make believe situation and think. "What if they would go left? They would be SAVED, wouldn't they?" Even viewing tv requires brains. And moreover we can watch television in the dark. But to read a book you need the lights on. Which also wastes electricity.
Yes I would say it has you relax in case your tired, but you can read to relax as well. Plus have you ever considered about the commercials and how annoying they are?
Yes it is illegal in the USA.  However, it can be done.  The person I know who's done it has never had a problem with the medications (in this case from India), and never had a problem with Customs or the Postal Inspector, etc.  I would not recommend it for drugs needed to treat serious life threatening conditions, because the quality is supposedly questionable.  But for other drugs I would do it if I didn't live so close to Mexico (where I can just go over the border and buy cheap prescription meds).If you do a google search on the drug name that you need, you will most likely find an overseas site which offers it for sale.Good luck, but remember it's illegal and potentially dangerous to your health.
Although technically, the previous answers are right ( you should pay your rent because of your contract etc), I would advise that you hold on to that rent payment and don't pay him! He sounds like a bit of a rogue, and if he is a crook you won't be seeing the whole amount of your deposit returned (typically landlords like him make up reasons such as cleaning bills, delapidation etc in order to retain your money) You're moving out at the end of December anyway and he has no power to just 'throw you out', he'd have to get an eviction notice and go through certain legal proceedures. The chances of him taking you to court are very slim, he would only do this if he thought you had caused damage to the property, but it sounds as though the property wasn't completely legal anyway (basic rights are to have a corgi certificate, working appliances etc)So, I say sod him!! Good luck x
Of course they would if they got in a position where they didn't want a child.  When a lot of those pro-lifers do get in that situation they will try to say something like "Oh I'm not like to the other females, because this or that happen, so this is why I'm having an abortion".  It's usually okay for them, but their anti-abortion when it's someone else.
Marijuana smoking should be legalised everywhere.It is a simple natural herb, which provides pleasure and relaxation, and has many beneficial medicinal properties. It relieves stress, reduces pain, and certain studies show that it can disipate asthma, and be beneficial to alzheimer's patients.The reason it was made illegal in the first place was because the oil from the seeds can be used to fuel an engine, and so the oil lobby, along with the media who were making profits from cutting down trees, found a way to make it illegal. The law was passed as a part of the tax law, which introduced the name marijuana, so that nobody would realise that they were restricting the use of hemp.
Why did the "true" gods of today's religions not see fit to make themselves known to early people from the Mesopotamian region? Wouldn't the Christian God, being a jealous god, have made himself known earlier than he did? If he's not really jealous, that still leaves the question of why he let man wonder around so long worshiping "false gods". Doesn't this provide reason to doubt all religions? How do we know that the earliest gods who were worshiped, aren't sitting "up there" seriously ticked off? Pissed that we are claiming each of their individual hard efforts to make us and the world we live in is actually the effort of one god? Pissed, that after explicitly putting their word forth, we strayed and worshiped false idols?
the cause to all problems is miscomunication because...car acccidents cause by drivers unawere of what other drivers are doingsomething turning into gossip because somebody did not take the time to say the full storyfights caused by 2 people who did not comumacate the rules about a game proplyterrirists blowing people up because the goverment would not listen to there concerns in the first placethere are lots more need i go on.
Humans are known as homo sapiens and are part of the animal kingdom. Therefore humans are animals. And how can a human be "above" an animal? What qualifies as above? Should there be some sort of intelligence limit that divides humans from being classified as animals? How does greater intelligence lift humans out of the animal category? Would an extremely bright dolphin no longer count as an animal? I must admit that humans are very different from the rest of the animal world, but I don't see how this elevates us in any way.
There is no disagree side but I disagree. There is a very good chance something may erupt between the U.S. and Iran. They and many other Arab/Muslim nations hate the West and are supporting terrorist organizations. So if a devastating attack occurs within the next few years Iran is the number one target. Also people have to realize that Israels interests are Americas interests; they are one in the same. So even if we do not have a war/conflict with Iran directly there is a good chance Israel may; which would involve us in the situation. The neoconservatives have been planting the seeds for some time now. Hopefully people can see how dangerous a group of people they are and how inaccurate they have been about their predictions. I hope it does not happen but there will be no fundamental change in our Middle Eastern foreign policy so war and conflict seem inevitable.
i think with this growing condition Idia cannot replace other developed countries like USA LONDON AND other countries.Because most of the people are illitrate here so i think india cant.
yes, i believe it's nice to have a school uniform. Each school 's uniform signifies its goal for instant i wore white shirt and blue skirt in my school days, white color is an indication of peace and blue of fidelity in relationships moreover identical uniform also removes the wall of status. it also depicts that whether a child comes from high or low class they all are treated equally under one roof .
An action is ethical if society as a whole would benefit if we all did it. Fair enough?If everyone had a gay marriage, then society as a whole would NOT benefit. In fact, we would all become extinct, because without one man and one woman there would be no reproduction and continuation of our species.Therefore, gay marriage can't be ethical.You can't refute my statement by saying, "There will always be straight people" because that's like saying killing someone is right because there will always be those who won't kill.
Yes. And they need to be pared down now. The Child Protective Services in my state make an awful mess of families with no real proof of any reason. They do the children more damage than good by ripping them from famlilies with no explanation, keeping them apart from their families and basically terrorizing everyone. Babies included. I have seen many families destroyed. My son's is one of them. And there seems to be no way to deal with them beyond letting them play thier God games and bowing low each time. Even saying "DHS" in relation to this situation lost one set of grandparents visitiation rights with the kids. This is way, way beyond the scope of their original job.
Many of these answers talk about the woman being able to choose what is going to happen to her body. What about the babies choice? No baby would decide...I"I think I want to be partially born, (at a time when I COULD live outside my mothers body) be stabbed in the skull and have my brain sucked out. How selfish are the women who think it is all about them and what they need or want? People that support this should be forced to watch one being performed......LIVE!
I think the pusillanimous behavior of professional soccer players playing up a slight bump by a member of the opposing team is unsportsmanlike and gives a poor image to the sport overall. It seems as though the player who was one moment ago crying out in agony is nearly always up running around after the other guy receives a yellow card (presumably because the first guy just received an almost death blow). If you look at football, basketball, etc., the players always brush off the bump and go right back into the game. Of course, I'm not saying that legit injuries don't occur, or that fouls shouldn't be punished. I'm simply saying that soccer is full of fakers and it pisses me off. Change my view.
American politicians have turned a blind eye to illegal immigration for too long. Crime is rampant on the border states and illegals are taking our jobs. On top of that our tax money goes to pay for their childrens public education and ER visits. They don't pay into the system but steal from it. Their very status should say it all --illegal--We need states to become more active in arresting illegals, more troops on the border, a fence, and a revision to citizenship "those who are born here = automatic citizens."
So, this place is a dumpy neighborhood bar located in a not-so great strip mall basically in an alley. For some reason, people bring their kids to this place even though it's a bar so it's usually really noisy. The food is actually really good. The wings are delicious and flavorful as are the buffalo chicken wraps and the onion rings. They are crispy, battered and greasy just like onion rings should be. Their ranch tastes homemade and is very good. Note that this is the kind of place where the bartenders/waitresses know most folks and when we were there, we happened to be sitting in someone's "regular" booth and the group of dads were playing fantasy football with their kids (???) so we felt the need to split so the gang could sit together. So, it is a neighborhood dive bar, lots of noisy kids, good food. Service is okay at best.
this is a load of bull excrament. These arguments are not factual and make your team seem like a bunch of foolish fools.

I am a christian. The bible says plain out that homosexuality is wrong. Call me pathetic, weak, or whatever you want to call me, but I know for sure that the bible is the TRUTH, the WHOLE truth, and the ONLY truth.
Yes, it should be of unlimited proportions. Freedom of speech should not and cannot be twisted to the point where it is no longer freedom of speech.However, freedom of speech goes hand in hand with the idea of personal responsibility and accountability. Producing those cartoons was technically legal, but it was irresponsible. Surely the cartoonist knew that those cartoons would cause trouble in extremist countries.However, I also think that the Islamic world is greatly overreacting. They are ruining their credibility and making themselves look like a bunch of whinging little kids who riot at the most petty insult. Do you know how many "Jesus Christ" parody websites exist online? How many Christians burn down embassies for stuff like that?
i think it could be argued that we already exist in exactly that misogynistic world you describe: - in the united states women are paid only 75¢ for every $1.00 a man is paid for the identical work.- 70% of the 1.3 billion people in the world loving in poverty are women.- two-thirds of the children denied even an elementary education are girls.- 75% of the world's 900 million illiterate adults are women.- women work two-thirds of the world's working hours and produce half the world's food, yet only earn 10% of the world's income and own less than 1% of the world's property.tell me exactly, how we're on such an even keel? how can anyone NOT be a feminist?
